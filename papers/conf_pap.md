### Notes

- EEBO does not rely on OCR for transcriptions.

- Hathi Trust and Google Books do.

### Potential Outline

1. Introduction. The background

    - In this talk I will tell you about an experiment with Optical Character Recognition--or OCR--which I attempted in collaboration with a fellow graduate student, Jenna Schoen. Jenna would have gladly co-presented these findings with me, and participated in this great panel with all of you. Unfortunately, she has been asked to deliver a paper on the Pearl manuscript in a session that is taking place right at this moment. So, you will have to content yourselves with the lesser half of the team for now. Nevertheless, both our contacts are listed here. In fact, both of us would be happy to discuss these ideas further on some other occasion--either at Kalamazoo or by email. [122]

    - Now, we started this side project about a year and a half ago, within Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research. We were also funded by Columbia's Data Science Institute to advance it over the summer of 2018. The experiment itself consisted in using a preexistent OCR software--called _Kraken_, like Tennyson's giant squid--to train a model for the automatic recognition and transcription of a Middle English book hand from the early 15th century. I will soon describe this process and these choices in more detail. [90]

    - However, before I do so, I would like to reflect on why we decided to attempt this experiment in the first place. Why should one try to use OCR for medieval manuscripts? Well, take EEBO for instance. The massive database of Early English Books Online, started in 1998, contains digital facsimiles of more than one hundred thousand books, adding up



    some reasons might sound almost redundant for a room full of medievalists. If computers could automatically transcribe 15th-century book hands with a decent degree of accuracy, scholars of the Middle Ages would

    that would be gained from teaching a computer to transcribe

     This fellow graduate student, whose name is Jenna Schoen, could not participate in this panel because she is currently delivering a paper on the Pearl manuscript in some other room around here.

    The advantages of Optical Character Recognition

    - Take EEBO, for instance. This massive database of Early English Books Online

    The Text Creation Partnership project, which was started

    - Is OCR efficient?

2. Preliminary choices. The system

    - In the fall of 2017 we contacted the team behind OpenITI, the Open Islamicate Texts Initiative. This international group of scholars--based in London, Leipzig, and College Park, Maryland--had just managed to successfully perform Optical Character Recognition on a corpus of classical Arabic-script books in print. In particular, the machine that they trained could transcribe texts with an accuracy that fluctuated between 70 and 90 percent. Of course, ... The difference between their goal and ours may seem great at first;

    - We deployed a turn-key OCR system called "Kraken"; this has been developed by Benjamin Kiessling, a scholar who works between Leipzig and Paris. It has been used for Arabic.

        - The ...

    - Open source; applications to Arabic

3. Preliminary choices. The corpus

    - Scribe D.

4. The process /1

    - Reliance on our own transcriptions; need to rewrite them from Furnivall.

        - Relied on a late 19th century transcription whose typographical features differed widely from what we needed.

[5. The process /2

    - Image quality.]

6. Results

    - Surprising?

7. Findings. Diplomatic Transcription

    - No such thing. There exists no consensus concerning what makes a diplomatic transcription a diplomatic transcription.

8. Findings. Should we rely on a dictionary?

    - Occasions when Furnivall gets it wrong.

[9. Findings. Perspectives

    - Multilingual MSs?]

10. Conclusions

    - An effort worth making? In what ways? What decisions concerning the future?
