2. To summarize, we decided to deploy a pre-existing, turn-key OCR software--Kraken--to estimate how feasible and scalable the automatic transcription of Middle English manuscripts could have become. Moreover, through this experiment we aspired to assess some of the challenges which medievalists might encounter in the process of applying this technique on a broader scale, as well as some of the strategies that might facilitate this task in the future. Since we aimed at this broad applicability, we chose to train the machine on a script that exhibited two features. First, we sought a script that was used to write a large number of extant Middle English manuscripts. Second, we preferred a script whose traits could be deemed representative of an even more comprehensive set of scripts; in other words, one that shared individual elements with other scripts, and whose general aspect--or _ductus_-- ...

in which a large number of extant Middle English manuscripts was written. Second, we

Since our experiment was meant to assess the feasibility and scalability of Optical Character Recognition for the automatic transcription of manuscripts written in Middle English,

    - Our choice fell ... (Decision to work on Anglicana Cursiva)

        - Reasons for AC; distinctly English, widely used; borrows from various systems of script.

            - Has it been transcribed efficiently so far?

        - Challenges of Anglicana.

3. Selection of texts for a Corpus: How have similar corpora been established so far? What criteria have we used?

    - Emphasize that recent scholarship has proven how these scribes would cooperate; their work would be orchestrated/organized/supervised to be as seamless as possible.
