2. To summarize, we decided to deploy a preexistent, turn-key OCR software--Kraken--to estimate the feasibility and scalability of automatic transcription for Middle English manuscripts. Through this experiment, we aspired to assess some of the challenges which medievalists might encounter in the process of applying this technique on a broader scale, as well as some of the strategies that might facilitate this task in the future. Since we aimed at comprehensiveness and at prospective applicability, we chose to train the machine on a script that exhibited two features. First, we sought a widespread script; put otherwise, one which was used to write many of the manuscripts in Middle English that survive to this day. Second, we sought an exemplary script; one which shared individual traits with other scripts, and whose general aspect--or _ductus_--could serve as a medial point between several chronologically adjacent scripts. The script identified as "Anglicana Formata" by Malcom @Parkes, and as "Cursiva Anglicana Media"--or "Formata"--by Julian @Brown, suited this description. As it is well known, this script was developed in the second half of the 13th century as a sort of functional yet relatively elegant book hand; it could be written more easily and rapidly than Gothic _textualis_, but it looked more legible and polished than a documentary cursive [@Roberts]. For this reason, Anglicana Formata became a standard choice for medium- and high-end Middle English manuscripts, and it became instrumental for the exponential increase in the insular production of vernacular books [@Wakelin]. Moreover, it encompassed letter forms drawn from older scripts--Gothic, documentary--and from newer scripts--Secretary [@Roberts]. Finally, the automatic transcription of its _ductus_ poses challenges shared with other scripts; for instance, it combines the loops and slants of documentary with the minims and compressions of Gothic [@Roberts].

3. Having chosen Anglicana Formata for its widespread use and for its exemplarity, we then based the selection of the manuscripts that comprised our small _corpus_ on the identification of a specific professional scribe and of his circle: "Scribe D"--possibly John Marchaunt--and the hands involved in the production of the Trinity _Confessio Amantis_ (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.2). Of course, this group of scribes has gained huge critical attention in the past few decades. Since Anthony Doyle and Malcom Parkes first conjectured a form of unsupervised collaboration among the five people who worked on this copy of _Confessio Amantis_ [@Doyle], many critics and paleographers have extensively researched--and often vehemently discussed--the identities, relationships, and attributions that might have shaped this scribal network. For instance, the identification of "Scribe D" with John Marchaunt--a clerk in the London Guildhall--was first proposed by Linne Mooney and Estelle Stubbs, and then challenged by Anthony Edwards and Lawrence Warner.

    - Emphasize that recent scholarship has proven how these scribes would cooperate; their work would be orchestrated/organized/supervised to be as seamless as possible.
