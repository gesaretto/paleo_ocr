In the 1340s a scribe in Ludlow compiled a collection of Middle English, Anglo-Norman, and Latin texts which curiously ranged from somber religious allegory to bawdy fabliau. The scribe then attached his folios to two booklets of Anglo-Norman religious writing (a previous scribe's work) and formed the manuscript now known as Harley 2253. Throughout his portion of the manuscript, the Ludlow scribe switches fluidly between Middle English, Anglo-Norman, and Latin: he rarely spends more than a few folios in a single language, he often jumps between Middle English and Anglo-Norman texts on the same page, and he even includes a few bilingual and trilingual poems. In its decided multilingualism, the manuscript is fertile ground for comparative literary analysis, whether scholars are interested in historicizing a multilingual 14th century England, exploring genres and themes across multiple languages, or tracking linguistic interplay and influence. But in the 20th century, the English, French, and Latin texts were never edited alongside each other. Instead, the Middle English texts were edited separately, and the Latin and Anglo-Norman texts were largely ignored. Even a facsimile of the manuscript left out the first two booklets (the Anglo-Norman texts copied by a different scribe). The Middle English lyrics were given special attention, and although the manuscript features Middle English and Anglo-Norman lyrics side-by-side, "Harley Lyrics" became shorthand for the Middle English lyrics alone. Scholarly analysis reinforced the decisions of scholarly editions and vice-versa: as the "Harley Lyrics" became a cornerstone of the Middle English canon, the manuscript itself was considered primarily significant for its unique and extensive collection of secular Middle English lyrics. Thus a distinctly multilingual manuscript was for decades edited and studied almost exclusively for its monolingual holdings, while little attention was given to its larger structural, thematic, and cross-linguistic meaning.

\[fix transition: If we consider the editorial history of Harley 2253 from a digital mindset, we can see that it is a clear case of data manipulation.\] In plucking the Middle English lyrics out of their original context and presenting them as a homogenous set, scholars mined the manuscript for select information and discarded the rest. They manipulated the manuscript's data according to a certain bias--in favor of Middle English and prejudiced against Latin and Anglo-Norman. Even the facsimile edition--typically the most transparent edition imaginable--distorted data by leaving out the first two quires, reflecting a bias in favor of single scribes. Of course, this is what editions *are*--selections, curations, manipulations. Though Harley 2253's history may be exemplary, any medieval manuscript's editorial history is a history of data manipulation. \[what's transition then?\]

As editors transfer from manuscript to print, data is always manipulated: new mediums provide (legibility, access, convenience, information) but constrain the information (page layout, material, handwriting, context). Digital platforms provide a whole new set of opportunities and constraints, a whole new kind of data manipulation. \[transition\]

It appears that the next major step in manuscript manipulation will be by machines. Thanks to advancements in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), several research teams (including our own) are successfully training machines to transcribe medieval scripts. As we move towards automatic transcriptions, however, questions about data manipulation and bias are as important as ever. As our team conducted experiments on OCR and medieval manuscripts, we were constrained in several ways by the OCR technology. However these constraints forced us to make new transcription decisions and to rethink transcription decisions that have been made throughout the history of manuscript studies.

Like any other time in a manuscript's editorial history, the present moment offers a specific set of constraints and possibilities. **We can see OCR as a moment in book history, just as we can read book history through the lens of data science.**
ocr as a moment in book history -- one which constrains us in a certain way and opens us up in a different way, one which offers certain questions (is it better automate transcriptions? how much of the manuscript should we render on the screen? is there a benefit to digital renderings of abbreviations -- i.e. fully diplomatic transcriptions?)
book history through data science -- as always biased and manipulative 

Machine learning requires researchers to be precise and thoughtful about their training data: when the training data is manuscript transcriptions, medievalists have to consider transcription decisions carefully. Especially as more medievalists begin to experiment with OCR, it is crucial that we consider our transcription decisions. But even outside machine learning, and simply within medieval studies, this experiment raises important considerations and forces us to reconsider the biases and decisions that undergird manuscript studies in the first place.

(footnote?) In the past twenty years, work has been done to reconsider Harley 2253 in its entirety, including a monumental TEAMS edition of the entire manuscript (with modern English translations of the French and Latin texts) and an essay collection "the manuscript as a whole" (Fein *Studies in the Harley Manuscript* 10). But for a significant time in medieval studies, scholars were primarily concerned with the "Harley Lyrics" rather than Harley 2253 itself.
