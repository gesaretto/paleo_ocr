    - work on the automatic identification of Manuscripts
    - contains a breakout of the distinctions between OCR and HTR (S89-90); they distinguish between OCR and HTR on the basis of **function**.

    - Discuss the "immediacy of mediation"

    > Mediation is not opposed to immediacy but rather is itself immediate. It names the immediacy of middleness in which we are already living and moving: Where do we find ourselves ... (129)

    - uses the notion of "transparency":

    > As half of the double logic of remediation, transparent immediacy holds that the subject's contact with the real depends upon the erasure of the medium, which correlates and thereby obscures the relationship between subject and world. [...] By using *remediation* I emphasize the point that both logics are at play in mediation, that the double logic of remediation entails both the transparency of media correlationism and the obscurity of radical mediation, and that these two different concepts of mediation are just as contradictory as immediacy and hypermediacy are. [...] immediacy is also used in remediation to refer to the embodied, affective experience that comes both from the direct encounter with the real provided by transparent mediation and from the immediate encounter with mediation provided by hupermediated modes of mediation ...

    - addresses--again--the question of how to cluster scripts together using artificial intelligence;

    - asks whether the system developed by computer scientists to identify scripts should work as a "black box for the use of paleographers" (providing useful results that we do not understand)

    - questions whether the problem with script identification may not lie with the humans who first devised these categories; deploys the software as a heuristic tool that helps paleographers

    - Makes some claims that we could easily agree with:

    > As Christopher Flüeler has recently noted, it is surprising how little the relationship between physical and digital manuscripts has been examined, at least in published work. (31)

    > Yet, in his plenary to the Medieval Academy of America in 2016, William Noel cautioned against our collective implicit equating of digitizations with manuscripts: digitizations are curated and therefore mediated objects, each carrying a history of technological and interpretive decisions that led to their presentation as digital objects. (32)

    > By way of conclusion, what we are essentially arguing is that as digital philologists, we should be aware that we are creating, not reproducing or straightforwardly representing, manuscript cultures. (41)

    - offers a survey of OCR approaches; explains that they are quite hard because of the difficulty posed by medieval manuscripts

    > Even if we set aside the substantial investments in time, equipment, and expertise needed to create high quality scans of medieval manuscripts, problems remain. Medieval manuscripts are practically impervious to contemporary OCR. (132)

    - Also, argues that there is much material that could be scanned and analyzed rapidly thanks to OCR.

    > Julie Orlemanski, in a similar vein, writes: "the 'great unread' of the Middle Ages is for the most part in manuscripts. Even when manuscripts are digitized ant thus potentially more accessible, their texts are rarely machine-readable." (133)

    - Examines difference between OCR and HTR (133-34)

    - Argues that digitizations and digital editions should be performed by small groups of scholars scattered around the world and collaborating thanks to the Internet

    - In short, offers a critique of "distant reading" and a reassessment of what is gained through "close reading." She also argues that medieval studies are both prone to reject distant reading (because so many texts remain inaccessible, in manuscript form) and strangely akin to it (because of their reliance on "peripheral" disciplines--codicology, paleography, and so on).

    > For scholars of medieval literature, Moretti’s experiments in scale may appear either irrelevant or old hat. Their seeming irrelevance stems from the fact that the “great unread” of the Middle Ages is for the most part in manuscripts. Even when manuscripts are digitized and thus potentially more accessible, their texts are rarely machine-readable. More seriously, Moretti’s aggregation of scholarship on various national literatures to form his sweeping data sets relies on certain shared characteristics of those literatures, like the capitalistic market for printed books. Given the relatively small and eclectic discourse communities characteristic of manuscript culture, it is not clear that more “distant” analysis is needed. On the other hand, distant reading loses its novelty for medieval literature insofar as the “other skills” Moretti recommends for a “larger literary history” — “statistics; work with series, titles, concordances, incipits” — are not dissimilar from the skills of medieval studies itself, with its subdisciplines of paleography, codicology, bibliography, dialect study, and philology (“Slaughterhouse” 209). Scholars of medieval literature have long operated at scales of reading other than close — a tendency that has sometimes isolated them within the field of literary study. (223)

    - have worked "on a total of 88 medieval manuscripts ranging from the ninth through thirteenth centuries."

    - Describe the relationships between OCR and HTR; argue that "there is a significant point to using OCR software--rather than other tools for handwritten text recognition (HTR)--because of the relative regularity of medieval hands and scripts overall, which may be analogous in some ways to print typefaces in a general way. [...] The differences between OCR (a long-established technology) and HTR (in an early phase of development) are subtle but substantial. The biggest difference lies with layout analysis and segmentation for processing: this stage is usually built into the OCR engine, while it is a separate stage in HTR. [...] Yet OCR and HTR technologies and processes have recently converged to some degree. Major OCR engines are also used on handwritten texts in various ways. Indeed, there is now some amount of overlap between OCR and HTR in practice because of developments in machine learning. .."

    - They also discuss Artificial Neural Networks in great detail; and they use OCropus

    - the goal of their experiment was to establish whether "the size and diversity of the training pool would be directly proportional to the quality of the resulting model when tested on 'seen' and 'unseen' manuscripts within the realm of Caroline minuscule scripts."

    - They bracket "the expansion of medi..."
