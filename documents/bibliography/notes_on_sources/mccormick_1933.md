McCormick, William. _The Manuscripts of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales_. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1933.

- Collation of all known CT manuscripts, i.e. shows every variation from "the standard" (namely, the Oxford printed edition of the _Ellesmere_ MS) in every MS
- Reproduces the first and last line of each Tale, Prologue, and Link + headings and colophons + division if marked by capitals + omissions/additions from the standard
- Sign map on page x and abbreviation key on page xi
- Contractions expanded w/o italics
- Several capital letters ignored (e.g. if impossible to tell, or used for legibility)
- Tags and strokes disregarded
- When can't tell if capital, preference to modern usage [would be a useful model, but can't really do that without language model]
- Special capitals marked by larger letters

Cp MS 198 Info
- Adds Gamleyn after A 4422
- Missing: Nun's Priest end-link, Merchant's head-link, Merchant end-link, Squire head-link, Squire-Franklin link, Retraction (MS missing after I 290)
- Nothing particularly relevant at the moment except line 872 in Knight's Tale is repeated and erased, and lines 2655 and 3045 are omitted [could be a useful guide later]
- Also worth noting that Scribe D cuts off at line 290 of the Parson's Tale and has no Retraction either

Note:
Still wondering about the gaps Doyle and Parkes say another scribe fills in... I don't see these mentioned in either McCormick or Manley/Rickert
