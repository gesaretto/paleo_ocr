    - Bolter and Grusin went on to identify two general strategies of representation which artists and designers can pursue in a wide variety of media forms: immediacy and hypermediacy. The strategy of immediacy, which might be called “transparency,” was favored by painters in Europe from the Renaissance until at least the nineteenth century. The development of linear perspective and other **illusionist** techniques enabled painters to claim that their pictures were **accurate reproductions** of what the eye saw when it looked on a scene in the physical world. Their techniques therefore made the painting into a **transparent window** onto the world, and the medium (paint on canvas) effectively disappeared for the viewer. The strategy of immediacy or transparency, which **seeks to make the medium disappear for the viewer or user**, remains an important aesthetic for popular media today. Hollywood cinema and so-called serious television drama generally employ this strategy. The drive to create photorealistic graphics for video games and virtual reality is a contemporary example of the desire for transparency.

        - *Note that this is reminiscent of Furnivall's self-presentation; the transparency and immediacy of his remediation from manuscript to print are highlighted in the temporary preface to the 6-text edition.*

        - *One can say that Furnivall's project entails two advantages: one, the rapidity of the new technology and the possibility of making these texts available for a broader public (quick, large-scale reproduction); two, the transparency of his endeavor--a rendition of the original MSs that is ostensibly "unmediated" and "undoctored"; free from secondary interventions. A faithful picture of the text contained in the original MSs.*

    The counterpart of transparency is hypermediacy. If the strategy of transparency seeks to make the medium disappear, hypermediacy foregrounds the medium and the process of mediation for the viewer or user. In the twentieth century, hypermediacy was associated with avant-garde painting, photography, or film, but in recent decades hyper-mediacy has become an increasingly popular style: examples include music videos and the multimedia, multiwindowed style of many websites, including popular social networking sites such as Facebook. The strategies of both hypermediacy and transparency can function for the remediation of other media forms. The desktop graphical user interface, for example, can remediate various forms of information (text, photographic images and graphics, and videos) in multiple windows. The screen becomes hypermediated as the user moves back and forth among windows reading and editing all these forms. Transparency can also be a remediating strategy: for example, virtual reality has been used to allow a viewer to “walk into” a Renaissance painting.

        - *What is hypermediacy in this context?* Is it something desirable? Is it the alternative we offer? Are we suggesting that OCR should be understood not as immediate but as *hypermediated*?
