- Transcriptorium/READ project  
- HTR techniques not accurate enough yet for reliable text indexing and search purposes
- Computer-assisted transcription as an alternative approach (IHTR)
- IHTR not sustainable for extensive collections, but useful for producing scholarly editions of moderate size
- Transcribed botany book of 1000 pages in 3 months uses IHTR
- Search queries can be performed based on confidence threshold at the line-level (a keyword search will return full lines that are likely to include that keyword, based on optical character models and N-Gram Language Models)
- 5 data sets: Plantas, Bentham, Austen, Alcaraz, WienSanktUlrich
- Results competitive compared to classical KWS systems (30% failure, 10% false positive)
- This technique requires pre-defined index of words
