- One should keep in mind that these rules belong to the field of **cataloging**.

- The definition of "diplomatic transcription" highlights its own limitations.

> **Diplomatic transcription**  
>  
> A method of transcription used in the production of a diplomatic edition (distinct from a type facsimile) that attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs the physical state of an individual manifestation of the text of a work, reproducing original spellings, punctuation, and capitalization and showing all additions, suppressions, or substitutions made to the text at the time of and subsequent to its creation. (144-45)  

- In the text of the handbook, the author highlights the fact that transcription should be regarded as a subjective practice.

> Transcription of manuscript text differs in many respects from transcription of printed text and those differences have important epistemological and practical consequences for the information contained in the catalog record. A basic principle of cataloging printed texts is that information is transcribed as accurately as possible as it is found in the source of information. Incunabula and early-printed texts often present difficulty in this regard because of the wide variety of irregular spellings, punctuation, capitalization, and use of abbreviation they possess. Manuscripts texts, however, exhibit these qualities to a much higher degree, particularly in the use of abbreviation, which make their transcription especially challenging--all the more so when it is further taken into consideration that the process involves transferring information from a handwritten source into a typographic medium. Because of differences between graphic (*i.e.*, written) and typographic (*i.e.*, printed) letter forms, transcription of manuscript text is not a straightforward process of transliteration, but frequently requires numerous editorial decisions to be made. Consequently, the role of the cataloger in transcribing manuscript text is best conceived of as interpretation, whereas in the case of printed texts is usually understood to be literal transcription. The final typographic representation of manuscript text, then, is necessarily a subjective matter and the manuscript catalog record, even at the level of transcription, is understood to be interpretive. (11)

- The book recommends that one expands all abbreviations.

> **0F8. Abbreviations**
>  
> Expand all suspensions, contractions, nomina sacra, Tironian notes, symbols, and other abbreviations to their full form, enclosing supplied letters or words in square brackets. When a choice of spelling is available in expanding abbreviations, render the expansion in accordance with the spelling conventions used in the text if it is possible to determine them with any consistency. In other words, do not substitute a classical spelling where the manuscript would use a medieval spelling (*e.g.*, do not substitute "prae" where the source favors ("pre"). Do not reproduce Tironian notae, the ampersand, or other symbols, but instead supply in square brackets the letters or words for which they stand in the language of the text. (12-13)

> An early manuscript can be transcribed in print in various ways. At one extreme lies the completely modernized text, reproducing the content only--all spellings modernized; punctuation, abbreviation, and the use of capitals standardized; contractions expanded. At the other extreme lies the nearest approach to facsimile reproduction that is attainable in type, a kind of printing which requires hand setting in a shop equipped with a great number of special type sorts--symbols, signs, and marks employed by medieval writers and still used in the sixteenth century. [...]  
> Inherent in fully modernized text is the disadvantage that the transcriber must also constantly be an editor; he must interpret, and in so doing he may often alter the writer's meaning. A further disadvantage lies in the loss, in such modernized texts, of linguistic detail important to some students. On the other hand, the production of a type facsimile today is so costly that books so printed can seldom pay their own way, and since, at best, the type reproduction of early manuscripts cannot be completely accurate and reliable, those who require detailed reproduction of this sort usually prefer photographic reproductions of originals, which are now usually obtainable without prohibitive cost. For the majority of students a modernized text or a compromise between the two extremes is satisfactory.  
> The transcripts accompanying the plates in this book have, of course, a special purpose, and this has dictated the editorial policies that we have adopted. While scrupulously adhering to original spelling and punctuation, we have thought it best to expand most abbreviations and contractions, which, left as written, would require constant glossing. This expansion is done silently, without any signal, on the assumption that in each instance it will be immediately apparent. [...] Where we do expand contractions and abbreviations we use the spelling favored by the individual writer if this can be inferred. (22-23)

- They acknowledge the problem of transcription in the introduction (written by Deborah J. Leslie, Chair of RBMS Bibliographic Standards Committee). This is the introduction to the 2007 revision of the Library of Congress rulebook on descriptive cataloging; the previous two were published in 1981 and 1991.

> The most significant changes from DCRB are: new introductory sections on "Objectives and Principles" and "Precataloging Decisions;" the explicit incorporation of machine-made books into the rule text and examples; the addition of Area 6; an expanded appendix on early letter forms and symbols (including images of early letters and symbols accompanied by their correct transcriptions); and new appendixes on collection-level cataloging, core-level cataloging, variations requiring the creation of a new bibliographic record, and individual issues of serials. (7)
>  
> DCRM(B) gives expanded guidance and prescribes a more rigorous and consistent approach to transcription than did DCRB, and incorporates a sharp distinction between information transcribed from the source and information that has been supplied by the cataloger. Transcribed information is never to be placed within square brackets (unless the letter or character is unclear; see 0G6.2). Conversely, the presence of square brackets in those areas of the description that require transcription (see introductory section III.2.2) immediately and unambiguously identifies text as supplied or interpolated. (8)

- The whole rulebook is structured after Elaine Svenonius's work on the philosophical principles of cataloging: *The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization*.

> **0G. Transcription**  
>  
> Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the source, according to these general rules 0B-0G, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules. Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition. [...]  
> In general, transcribe letters as they appear. Do not add accents and other diacritical marks not present in the source. Convert earlier forms of letters and diacritical marks to their modern form (see Appendix G2). In most languages, including Latin, transcribe a ligature by giving its component letters separately. (34-35)

- The book contains an appendix (appendix G) that lists rules for the transcription of "archaic letter and character forms"; it invites readers to expand all abbreviations.

4. Svenonius, Elaine. *The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization*. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2000.

-  She identifies six principles and two subprinciples (these seem to be drawn from the Anglo-American cataloging literature). Some of these relate to the question of transcription:

> - *Principle of user convenience* Decisions taken in the making of descriptions should be made with the user in mind. A subprinciple of this is the  
>     - *Principle of common usage* Normalized vocabulary used in descriptions should accord with that of the majority of users.  
> - *Principle of representation* Descriptions should be based on the way an information entity describes itself. A subprinciple is the  
>     - *Principle of accuracy* Descriptions should faithfully portray the entity described.  
> - *Principle of sufficiency and necessity* Descriptions should be sufficient to achieve stated objectives and should not include elements not required for this purpose. A subprinciple is the  
>     - *Principle of significance* Descriptions should include only those elements that are bibliographically significant.  
> - *Principle of standardization* Descriptions should be standardized, to the extent and level possible.  
> *Principle of integration* Descriptions for all types of materials should be based on a common set of rules, to the extent possible.  
> (p. 68)

- Transcription is evoked in the section on "accuracy."

> A description is inaccurate if it any way misrepresents an entity, making it seem what it is not. In bibliographic contexts, accuracy, in the sense of honest portrayal, is equated with truth in transcription. Truthfully transcribing how a document represents itself is necessary for the identification and communication of bibliographic information.  
> (p. 71)

- (Note that Svenonius, like most sources who discuss "transcription" in relation to cataloging, understands "transcription" as something that happens in a specific context and with a specific purpose: that is, the transcription of information drawn from the book or document, made in order to identify it--say, for instance, the title of a work as it appears on the frontispiece, "transcribed" exactly as it appears to avoid ambiguity.)

- Svenonius discusses transcription again in the context of "representation"; she highlights that this principle must have "limitations."

> The principle of representation if carried too far would result in bibliographic descriptions that individually are correct but when taken collectively are inconsistent. It would go against the principle of user convenience if bibliographic records--say, for books--were literal copies of their title pages. [...] To facilitate scanning, certain aspects of description need to be made uniform. These include the selection of data elements, the order in which they are displayed, and their punctuation, capitalization, an abbreviation. Thus, the principle of representation is curtailed by the need for consistently formatted bibliographic records. (74)

- The principle of "standardization," as described by Svenonius, seems to have less to do with transcription; it refers to the kind of information that should be contained in a catalog entry--what to include and how to convey it should be standardized in order to be easily accessible.

- Dagenais explains that he has tried to reproduce the aspect of the manuscript, but without striving for diplomatic status; he wants to underline that the text he offers is nothing more than a **surrogate** (an artifact that openly displays its incompleteness, its dependence from an absent original; a sort of "nostalgia").

> Regarding the transcriptions of manuscript texts, I want to stress from the outset that they do not strive for diplomatic status. Their major function is to serve as a reminder that the material I cite is drawn from a medium radically different from the modern printed page on which we read it. In agreement with the themes of this book, the transcriptions represent the manuscript text as best I can capture it in two stages of existence. At the fist level, the transcriptions seek to represent in the print medium certain features of the text on the manuscript page, stripped of modern accretions (capitalizations, punctuation, standard word division) and with portions of the medieval text preserved (most notably scribal "errors," punctuation, and physical spacing). I have tried to reflect rudiments of scribal *usus*, so that readers may eventually be able to recognize the manuscript in question from the transcription. Thus, my transcription uses the tyronian sign, and, when appropriate, paragraphs (*calderones*) and marginal material. (xx-xxi)

6. Baker, Donald C. "Frederick James Furnivall (1825-1910)." *Editing Chaucer. The Great Tradition*, ed. Paul G. Ruggiers, Norman: Pilgrim Books, 1984.

- Argues that Furnivall's work on Chaucer's manuscripts should be regarded as the necessary foundation for all subsequent critical and philological endeavors; in a footnote (6) on p. 280, Baker explains that the editor of the first jumbo-sized edition of *The Canterbury Tales*, John M. Manly, was greatly indebted to Furnivall's transcriptions (which would be soon replaced by photographic reproductions).

    - Photography made printed facsimiles such as Furnivall's redundant (although Furnivall's transcription represented a sort of compromise between faithfulness to the aspect of the MS and readability for the general user); but up to the moment when photographs became available, a printed edition such as Furnivall's would have been more helpful.

    - Given the capabilities of digitized archives, where information can be concealed or displayed according to the needs of the user, transcriptions such as Furnivall's are made viable and somewhat necessary again; they will make this kind of information searchable, and allow researchers to investigate it through computational methods.

> In the essay "Origin and Development of Our Plan," (1.1) Manly makes clear that the Furnivall prints pointed the way for the great Chicago work, which was enabled to go beyond the Chaucer society achievement, to some extent at any rate, by the availability of cheap photographic reproduction, which was, of course, unavailable very much earlier. Who can doubt that if this method had been available to Furnivall *all* the *Canterbury Tales* known to exist would have been printed? But the Manly-Rickert *Text*, of course, became a great *edition*, assembling and organizing the material which Furnivall, even had he access to the new technology, would probably only have printed. He saw himself, as always, as preparing the ground for other scholars. (280)

- Note that Robinson's edition (which forms the basis for the Riverside Chaucer) was prepared by looking at:

    - "all the published manuscript materials and photographs or collations of some of the more important published sources";

    - although Robinson eventually chose a "best" manuscript and edited "it in the light of the others, using common sense and scholarly knowledge and experience" (G. F. Reinecke, "F. N. Robinson," *Editing Chaucer*, 239);

    - Robinson meticulously compared his edition with the one prepared by Manly and Rickert, often accepting their variants (249);

    - Robinson's edition became the standard over the course of the XX century; the *Riverside Chaucer* that we read today largely coincides with it.

- The same could be said for Skeat's edition, dated 1894; this was based on Furnivall's work and on the Six-Text edition (p. 179); it will be the basis for the upcoming Oxford version, edited by C. Cannon and J. Simpson.

- In other words, Furnivall's work on the Six-Text edition constitutes the basis for all the editorial and critical work done on Chaucer during the 20th century--until this day.

- Here is how Baker describes Furnivall's editions:

> It is not exaggeration at all to say that the selection and printing of this series of texts was the most important contribution by one man to the tradition of Chaucerian textual study [...]. (159)

> The texts themselves are much alike, in appearance like those of the EETS. Furnivall, as he tells us, aimed to reproduce the manuscript itself as closely as possible, expanding obvious abbreviations (with italics), but generally wherever there was a doubt about practice reproducing the brevigraphs used by the scribes with a variety of printed symbols. The appearance of the page, as Bradshaw noted of the volumes of EETS, certainly gives an impression of scholarly impeccability. How accurate are these texts? [...] Errors, of course, abound, but largely of a minor nature. The remarkable thing which I concluded was that, considering the amount of material, the errors are quite surprisingly few, and, more importantly, consist largely of inconsistencies in representing letters (*i-j*, *u-v*, etc.) and in expansions, all of which Furnivall freely admits in his *Temporary Prefaces*. (164)

> As an *editor*, as I have remarked, his work cannot really be evaluated, for he never, in a sense *edited* anything. He printed, but how fully, how gloriously he printed! He made all modern editions possible. In every aspect of Chaucerian study his work is found. [...] Whether we condescend in our own day of supersophisticated (perhaps too sophisticated) concepts of editing even to admit Furnivall into our ranks, he is the giant upon whose shoulders we all stand--enthusiastic, genial, enormously hard-working, quick to judgment and quick to admit error, encouraging all who followed and criticized and bettered his own work. (169)

7. Febvre, Lucien and Henri-Jean Martin. *The Coming of the Book. The Impact of Printing 1450-1800*. Trans. David Gerard, Norfolk: Verso, 1976.

- The writers argue that the invention of print might have caused the reduction of special characters and abbreviations.

> To begin with, there was the problem of making type sorts. Not only did the printer need a foolproof method of making them with the aid of punches and moulds [...] An even greater drawback was the use of so many typographic signs imitated from the handwriting employed in writing manuscripts. The first printers cast letters joined by ligatures and used standard abbreviations (*a* [with line on top] for *an* or *am*; *q* for *quia*) so that there were many more typographic signs than there are today. It makes us wonder whether the gradual abandonment of the ligatures and abbreviations so common in the 15th and 16th centuries was not partly due to a wish to reduce the number of punches and matrices needed, one aspect of the tendency toward uniformity and simplification so characteristic of the evolution of the book. (57)

- They also tell us that the choice of Caroline ("humanistic hand") for printed materials was not an obvious choice.

> Around 1450, when printing was invented, texts were being written, according to their contents or their intended recipients, in very different hands. In fact four main styles of script were current, each with its own specific purpose. *[They list: "scholastic" gothic, "missal" gothic, "bastard" gothic, and the "humanist" or "roman" script.]* Inspired by the Carolingian minuscule, this script was made fashionable by Petrarch and his disciples, but in 1480 [NB: **Petrarch died in 1374.**] was used only by a few exclusive groups of humanists, or by aristocratic book collectors who wanted their classical texts to have a look of antiquity and authenticity about them [...]. (79)

> Such were the different models that were available to early printers; and this diversity explains the extraordinary variety of the letters used in the first incunabula and even in early 16th-century books. There was a conventional type for each class of book and reader, just like there had been in the manuscript period [...]. (79)

> Some printers went further in imitating manuscript handwriting, as did Le Talleur, a printer of Rouen, who published two treatises on Anglo-Norman law for Richard Pynson, the English bookseller of Norman extraction. To do this work he cast a type quite different from his normal model, and tried to copy the cursive script used peculiarly by English scribes for this class of work.  
> Gradually, printing became more uniform for quite material reasons. (80)

- Elements that could cause ambiguity or a loss of information:

    - ampersand and tironian et?
    - punctus versus and punctus elevatus?

        - according to KF, these are supposed to mean "voice rising" and "voice falling."

    - distinction between thorn, eth, and "th"?

    - Maybe all of them together? Notion that ambiguity concerning the transcription of all these character causes an inevitable loss of information?

> In Anglicana the upper lobe of round **s** is left open, thus acquiring the form of figure 6. It was traced in a simple one-stroke clockwise ductus, and may often be observed in the lower levels of execution. More typical and sophisticated is the form giving **s** the same style as **d** and **e** which was obtained through a different ductus [...]. This form, also found in certain documentary scripts, is in fact not far removed from the looped straight **s**, especially if the round letter was made taller than the other short letters. This could explain a most noteworthy feature of Anglicana: the use of round **s** at the beginning of words. With the exception of a few German hands, this feature occurs only in Anglicana and gives this script a unique place among late medieval book scripts. Although round **s** in initial position may alternate with straight **s**, and tended to disappear in the course of the fifteenth century under Cursiva influence, the feature remains a remarkable characteristic of Anglicana. Straight **s** was always used in the middle of words. (138-39)
