> A method of transcription used in the production of a diplomatic edition (distinct from a type facsimile) that attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs the physical state of an individual manifestation of the text of a work, reproducing original spellings, punctuation, and capitalization and showing all additions, suppressions, or substitutions made to the text at the time of and subsequent to its creation.

- The author highlights the fact that transcription should be regarded as a subjective practice.

> Consequently, the role of the cataloger in transcribing manuscript text is best conceived of as interpretation, whereas in the case of printed texts is usually understood to be literal transcription.

- The book recommends that one expands all abbreviations.

> **0F8. Abbreviations**
>  
> Expand all suspensions, contractions, nomina sacra, Tironian notes, symbols, and other abbreviations to their full form, enclosing supplied letters or words in square brackets. When a choice of spelling is available in expanding abbreviations, render the expansion in accordance with the spelling conventions used in the text if it is possible to determine them with any consistency. In other words, do not substitute a classical spelling where the manuscript would use a medieval spelling (*e.g.*, do not substitute "prae" where the source favors ("pre").

> An early manuscript can be transcribed in print in various ways. At one extreme lies the completely modernized text, reproducing the content only--all spellings modernized; punctuation, abbreviation, and the use of capitals standardized; contractions expanded. At the other extreme lies the nearest approach to facsimile reproduction that is attainable in type, a kind of printing which requires hand setting in a shop equipped with a great number of special type sorts--symbols, signs, and marks employed by medieval writers and still used in the sixteenth century. [...]  
> Inherent in fully modernized text is the disadvantage that the transcriber must also constantly be an editor; he must interpret, and in so doing he may often alter the writer's meaning. A further disadvantage lies in the loss, in such modernized texts, of linguistic detail important to some students. On the other hand, the production of a type facsimile today is so costly that books so printed can seldom pay their own way, and since, at best, the type reproduction of early manuscripts cannot be completely accurate and reliable, those who require detailed reproduction of this sort usually prefer photographic reproductions of originals, which are now usually obtainable without prohibitive cost. For the majority of students a modernized text or a compromise between the two extremes is satisfactory.  
> The transcripts accompanying the plates in this book have, of course, a special purpose, and this has dictated the editorial policies that we have adopted. While scrupulously adhering to original spelling and punctuation, we have thought it best to expand most abbreviations and contractions, which, left as written, would require constant glossing. This expansion is done silently, without any signal, on the assumption that in each instance it will be immediately apparent. [...] Where we do expand contractions and abbreviations we use the spelling favored by the individual writer if this can be inferred. (22-23)

- They acknowledge the problem of transcription in the introduction (written by Deborah J. Leslie, Chair of RBMS Bibliographic Standards Committee). This is the introduction to the 2007 revision of the Library of Congress rulebook on descriptive cataloging; the previous two were published in 1981 and 1991.

> The most significant changes from DCRB are: new introductory sections on "Objectives and Principles" and "Precataloging Decisions;" the explicit incorporation of machine-made books into the rule text and examples; the addition of Area 6; an expanded appendix on early letter forms and symbols (including images of early letters and symbols accompanied by their correct transcriptions); and new appendixes on collection-level cataloging, core-level cataloging, variations requiring the creation of a new bibliographic record, and individual issues of serials.
>  
> DCRM(B) gives expanded guidance and prescribes a more rigorous and consistent approach to transcription than did DCRB, and incorporates a sharp distinction between information transcribed from the source and information that has been supplied by the cataloger. Transcribed information is never to be placed within square brackets (unless the letter or character is unclear; see 0G6.2). Conversely, the presence of square brackets in those areas of the description that require transcription (see introductory section III.2.2) immediately and unambiguously identifies text as supplied or interpolated.

- The whole rulebook is structured after Elaine Svenonius's work on the philosophical principles of cataloging: *The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization*. She identifies ...
