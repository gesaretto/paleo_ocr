> A method of transcription used in the production of a diplomatic edition (distinct from a type facsimile) that attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs the physical state of an individual manifestation of the text of a work, reproducing original spellings, punctuation, and capitalization and showing all additions, suppressions, or substitutions made to the text at the time of and subsequent to its creation.

- The author highlights the fact that transcription should be regarded as a subjective practice.

> Consequently, the role of the cataloger in transcribing manuscript text is best conceived of as interpretation, whereas in the case of printed texts is usually understood to be literal transcription.

- The book recommends that one expands all abbreviations.

> Expand all suspensions, contractions, nomina sacra, Tironian notes, symbols, and other abbreviations to their full form, enclosing supplied letters or words in square brackets. When a choice of spelling is available in expanding abbreviations, render the expansion in accordance with the spelling conventions used in the text if it is possible to determine them with any consistency. In other words, do not substitute a classical spelling where the manuscript would use a medieval spelling (*e.g.*, do not substitute "prae" where the source favors ("pre").
