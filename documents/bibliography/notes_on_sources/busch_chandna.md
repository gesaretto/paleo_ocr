- eCodicolgy project (joint collaboration in Germany, working with St. Matthias library) to detect and measure layout features of manuscript using pattern recognition software
- Trying to verify whether aspect ration aligns with classical aesthetic ideals (Pythagorean Theorem, Golden Ratio etc)
- Developed SWATI (Software Workflow for Automatic Tagging of Images)
  - Pre-process images (remove noise, deal with different resolutions)
  - Train algorithms on object segmentation with ImageJ and MOA
  - Feature extraction (page height, page width, etc)
  - Save data as XML-TEI file
- Also do some data visualization of manuscript metadata with CodiVis
- Not all the manuscripts have accurate or complete metadata in the collection, so that's an issue
- Processed 170,000 pages so far, need more time to analyze results
