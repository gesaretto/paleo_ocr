- Used Kraken to train 1,466 lines of Ibn al-Faqīh’s Kitāb al-Buldān (print edition), with 97.56% accuracy on text, then tested it on 6 other Arabic trexts with accuracy ranging from 71.87% to 97.80%.
- Quality of image not as important as typeface similiarity.
- Kraken's workflow allows you to train new models easily.
- Good to use pre-transcribed texts.
- They want to create a library of models for Arabic scripts, including general script models and individual typeface/editorial models.
- Also plan to release web-interface for training.
- Kraken uses a long short-term memory neural network network utilizing the Connectionist Temporal Classification objective function. The objective function used during training is geared towards assigning labels—i.e., characters/glyphs—to regions of unsegmented input data (which is good for connected scripts).
