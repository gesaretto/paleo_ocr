- Special features: Many tales numbered, obviously unfinished, paragraph marks irregular, irregular explicits/incipits
- Provenance: "Burle" on f.146 in dry-point, so probably belonged to Burle family in 15th century (in Chaucer's social circle), bottom of f.1 identifies Fulman (1632-88), a tutor to Edward Peyto who probably inherited books from his mother and great-aunt, Peyto family remotely connected to Burleys and Grey de Wiltons through marriage into Ferrers family, so Fulman may have gotten book from Peytos
