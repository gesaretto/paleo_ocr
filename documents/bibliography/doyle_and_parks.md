Doyle, A.I. and M.B. Parkes. "The production of copies of the _Canterbury Tales_ and the _Confessio Amantis_ in the early fifteenth century." in _Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts, and Libraries: Essays Presented to N.R. Ker_." London: Scolar Press, 1978.

- Looks at the Trinity MS R32 of Gower's Confessio Amantis, which has 5 different hands (Scribes A-E).  
- Since some stints are not completed, and there are certain inconsistencies in lines per page/column layout, concludes that each scribe composed their respective stints individually, and that they weren't working in one workroom, but using one exemplar - no evidence for workshop
- Dates Trinity MS R32 1408-1426
- Most likely made in London or Westminster
- Handwriting suggests they had different backgrounds
- Also looks at CT manuscripts and argues that they are different *compilatios* according to different concerns, no one definitive, based on different exemplars or different instructions
- Stationers took on the financial responsibility and organization of these scribes
- Hoccleve (scribe E) and others were not full time copyists but took these jobs on commission for extra cash
- Why so close to each other in style then? Maybe lived near each other and imitated each other
- Lays out scribal profile each scribe. For Scribe D (p.178):
  - Based upon a variant of anglicana formata particularly common in vernacular manuscripts of 15th century  
  - Careful proportions and disciplined quality  
  - Tops of minims are level height, bottoms irregular  
  - **w*** is distinct
  - **I** has minor variations in approach stroke
  - variants in _litterae notabiliores_ especially **A** in beginning of lines
  - secretary forms of **s** and **r**
  - **h** tail-stroke tucked under
  - rounded downward curve on some shoulders of final long-**r***
  - catchwords and directions for artist almost certainly D's informal hand  
- Theoretical History on Scribe D (p. 195-6):
  - His Piers Plowman probably one of his earliest efforts
  - Probably worked from around 1390-1426
  - Probably a full time scribe
  - Very little variation over his career
  - D and B produced highest quality work of period     
- Info on MS 198 (p. 192-3):
  - Best representation of the 'c' tradition of CT
  - Defective at end
  - D left some gaps which are filled in by other scribes [where? this would be useful to know]
  - *Ordinatio* interpretes CT as sequence of stories on different topics
  - Tries to conceal gaps (i.e. adds Tale of Gamelyn to Cook's Tale)
  - Headings and colophons in same ink as the text, placed so that no visible gaps
  - Headings in Latin/English follow no formula
  - Vestiges of chapter numbers in headings and rulers (not margins)
- Difference between D and Δ (pp. 178, 206-8):
  - D and Δ very similar in style, especially in Δ's Paris manuscript
  - Both set pace for the script
  - D's tops of minims are level height, bottoms irregular
  - Δ's tops irregular and bottoms fairly level, more uneven  
  - Also difference between forms of **r** and **s**
  - Note: anglicana formata is used for Latin manuscripts, just different aspect (not formation)
