2. To summarize, we decided to deploy a preexistent turn-key OCR software--Kraken--to estimate the feasibility and scalability of automatic transcription for Middle English manuscripts. Through this experiment, we aspired to assess some of the challenges which medievalists might encounter in the process of applying this technique on a broader scale, as well as some of the strategies that might facilitate this task in the future. Since we aimed at comprehensiveness and at prospective applicability, we chose to train the machine on a script that exhibited two features. First, we sought a widespread script; put otherwise, one which was used to write many of the manuscripts in Middle English that survive to this day. Second, we sought an exemplary script; one which shared individual traits with other scripts, and whose general aspect--or _ductus_--could serve as a medial point between several chronologically adjacent scripts. The script identified as "Anglicana Formata" by Malcom @Parkes, and as "Cursiva Anglicana Media"--or "Formata"--by Julian @Brown, suited this description. As it is well known, this script was developed in the second half of the 13th century as a sort of functional yet relatively elegant book hand; it could be written more easily and rapidly than Gothic _textualis_, but it looked more legible and polished than a documentary cursive [@Roberts]. For this reason, Anglicana Formata became a standard for medium- and high-end Middle English manuscripts; after 1375, it proved instrumental for the exponential increase in the insular production of vernacular books [@Wakelin]. Moreover, it encompassed letter forms drawn from older scripts--Gothic, documentary--and from newer scripts--Secretary [@Roberts]. Finally, the automatic transcription of its _ductus_ poses challenges shared with other scripts; for instance, it combines the loops and slants of documentary with the minims and compressions of Gothic [@Roberts].

3. Having chosen Anglicana Formata for its widespread use and for its exemplarity, we then selected the manuscripts that would comprise our small _corpus_ among those attributed to a particular professional scribe and to his circle: "Scribe D"--possibly John Marchaunt--and the scribes involved in the production of the Trinity _Confessio Amantis_ (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.2). In particular, we trained the machine on a manuscript that was attributed to Scribe D (Oxford, Corpus Christi Coll., MS 198), and we tested the resulting model on four other manuscripts: two attributed to him (the Trinity _Confessio Amantis_ itself; and London, Brit. Lib., MS Harley 7334), and two attributed to Scribe B--possibly Adam Pinkhurst--(Cambridge, Trinity College, B.15.17; ...). We selected these particular manuscripts because we hoped to assess two additional questions through our experiment; first, to what extent a machine trained on the hand of one scribe could also satisfactorily transcribe texts written in a different hand; second, whether a machine could be adequately trained on the hands of two scribes simultaneously. We aspired to concentrate on scribal differences alone; to minimize the effect of other factors, these hands should have shared a common script, and a similar historical and geographical background. Because of the well-attested collaboration within the group of scribes to which Scribe D belonged, we could assume a spatial and chronological proximity between him and Scribe B, and an attempt to uniform their script. In fact, since Anthony Doyle and Malcom Parkes first conjectured a form of unsupervised collaboration among the five people who worked on this copy of _Confessio Amantis_ [@Doyle], many critics and paleographers have extensively researched--and often vehemently discussed--the individual identities of these scribes, their hypothetical common background, and the relationships that might have shaped their scribal circle.

    - For instance, the identification of "Scribe D" with John Marchaunt--a clerk in the London Guildhall--was first proposed by Linne Mooney and Estelle Stubbs in their daring volume _Scribes and the City_. . and then challenged by Anthony Edwards and Lawrence Warner in subsequent reviews and .
