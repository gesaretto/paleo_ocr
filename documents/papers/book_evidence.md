### On Middle English MSs Production in General

- Question: How many Middle English MSs survive to this day? How many of these have been transcribed? How many of these have been digitized?

    - (And, in case it bears any relevance, how many texts would have arguably circulated in the late Middle Ages?)

1. A. Gillespie. *Production and Dissemination*

    - She shows how dramatically the production of books increased over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries; more and more people were trained as--and regarded themselves as--*professional scribes*; thanks to the dissemination of paper, the production of books became cheaper and more common.

        - Even the **script itself**--with its move from _textualis_ to a more _cursive_ style--facilitated a faster and more abundant production of books. (p. 103)

    > ...the production of medieval texts in written forms was _never_ an unskilled or a casual activity. It was always a technologically knowing one, involving hard physical labour and requiring access to training and scarce resources. (104)

    - The amount of texts that were available in Middle English remains unspecified; but Gillespie refers to a sharp **increase** in the production of Middle English texts around the end of the 14th century, and to a shift in the ratio of texts produced.

    > And by the end of the Middle Ages--although books were never written within the reach of the vast majority of the populace, whose subsistence lifestyles left no time or cash for luxuries--there _were_ more written texts of all kinds about, to be read aloud from or to be read silently. They were more often in English: __about ten times more Middle English literary manuscripts survive from the century after 1375 than from the century before that date__. They were therefore accessible to the middling sort of medieval person (Edwards and Pearsall 1989; Meale 1989).

### On the Scripts

#### On Anglicana

#### On the Cursive of the CC Piers

### On Individual Scribes

#### On Scribe D

1. Doyle & Parkes. The Production of Copies of the *Canterbury Tales*.

    - Seminal work on this scribe.

    - Six quires of the TG (9, 15-19; also completed quire 14--which was begun by Scribe A)

#### On Scribe B

1. Doyle & Parkes. The production of Copies of the *CT*.

    - Three quires of (2-4) of the Trinity Gower;

### On Individual Manuscripts

#### On CC 198

- McCormick, *The Manuscript of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales*. Oxford **1933**

    - Disregards *glosses*; ...

#### On Trinity Gower

- Doyle & Parkes. The Production of Copies of the *CT*.

    - They argue that the various parts of the MS were composed simultaneously; the scribes were simultaneously transcribing different quires of the same MS. This is also confirmed by some errors in the handling of transitions from one quire to the next (as if the scribe did not have the following--or the previous--quire available).

        - In particular, the "stint" attributed to Scribe B (quires 2-4) is followed by a single leaf written by Scribe C and attached to the beginning of the following quire (5); this leaf supplies the text that is not found on either quire--the text which links the two. This correction strongly suggests that Scribe B wrote less than what Scribe C had imagined; because they were writing *simultaneously but not next to each other*.

        - [Does this mean that the feasibility of this kind of automatic transcription increases the closer these scribes were working together? (Is this a good argument for the transcription of Anglicana?)]

### Theory of Transcription?

- Text that discusses how _all transcription is a form of interpretation_?

### On Potential Applications

- Capelli, Roberta. "Practical and Theoretical Implications of Digitizing the Middle Ages." CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture. Vol. 15, Issue 3 **2013**

    - Capelli explores some of the advantages of working with a digital MS rather than with a physical one; in particular, she argues that a digital edition of a text could resort to *hypertextual structures* (multiple layers of information connected with each other) in order to show the multiplicity of witnesses--of unique instantiations--that correspond to that abstract, impossible "text."

    > On the other hand, digital formats bring to the fore the natural hyper textual dimension of the medieval text taken as a cultural diasystem, an entity that is able to give us tangible and intangible multi-ordered, multilevel, and multi-layered information (on philological hypertexts see, e.g., BÃ©rard and Mordenti). A single page from a manuscript may provide a series of multi-ordered information (text and paratext), multilevel information (palimpsestic writing) and multi-layered information (variants and copying activity from multiple sources). The tangible and intangible pluridimensionality of the manuscript or of the subunit folio requires synchronization of all the data and metadata which they are capable of providing and which is impossible to realize in the static and linear form of traditional printing, but which is congenial to the non-linear form of the hypertext.

    - Capelli argues that the errors made by an OCR machine could be compared with those made by a scribe.

    > Together with the author's and the copyist's variant, I would like to mention the "technological variant": using an OCR software the attempts made so far to scan, acquire, and restore the manuscript have produced paleographic errors made by the machine which are altogether similar to those made by scribes such as erroneous grouping of adjacent letters, distortion of letters with bars, wrong recognition of spaces between letters and words, etc. (see Tomasi and Tomasi 198-200)

    - Capelli seems to highlight a **tension** between the fac-simile and the critical edition; the fac-simile reproduces the text(s) as it (they) exist(s)--the unique instantiation of that piece of writing, recollected by a scribe within a precise spatial, temporal, cultural context; the critical edition reproduces something _which does not exist_--the text outside of these instantiations; the ideal Ur-text which--as we know--constitutes a pure abstraction.

        - [As a consequence, the opportunity to map our text--the diplomatic transcription of the text; the "plain text" version of the text; not a "critical edition," and yet closer to a critical edition--onto the facsimile--the photographic reproduction of that unique instantiation; illegible in itself--highlights this tension. The two *are not the same*; there is a *gap* between the two--the _machine highlights the gap that there exists between the two_.]
