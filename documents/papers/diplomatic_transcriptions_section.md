All the editions of the *Canterbury Tales* that we read today share an unexpected ancestor--a forebear that does not date back to the age of Chaucer, but to the Victorian era. In 1868, the enterprising Cambridge graduate Frederick James Furnivall founded the Chaucer Society with a distinct mission: "to let the lovers and students of [*Chaucer*] see how far the best unprinted Manuscripts of his works differ[ed] from the printed texts."[^note_furnivall_preface] According to Furnivall, the circulation of these previously unedited--or, in his words "unprinted"--medieval manuscripts would fulfill a critical scholarly need.

> There are many questions of metre, pronunciation, orthography, and etymology yet to be settled, for which more prints of Manuscripts are wanted, and it is hardly too much to say that every line of Chaucer contains points that need reconsideration.

Furnivall planned to facilitate the "reconsideration" and the "settl[ing]" of these textual quandaries by issuing the "prints of Manuscripts" which were ostensibly most "wanted" by his contemporaries. As a consequence, he personally supervised the production and the circulation of many "printed" manuscripts from the Middle Ages. All in all, his titanic endeavors proved quite valuable. According to a present-day scholar, "the selection and printing of this series of texts was the most important contribution by one man to the tradition of Chaucerian textual study."[^note_baker] In short, every modern edition of Chaucer's poem ultimately rests on the reliability and convenience of Furnivall's "prints."[^note_modern_editions]

[^note_modern_editions]: In particular, Furnivall's *Six-Text Edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales*--which appeared as an eighth-volume series of extravagantly "oblong folios," displaying the printed texts of six different manuscripts in parallel columns--was extensively consulted by the great Chaucerian editors of the period, including William W. Skeat--who edited *The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*--and John Manly and Edith Rickert--who edited the seminal *Text of the Canterbury Tales*. These editions were in turn perused by subsequent editors, such as F.N. Robinson--whose *The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer* became the foundation for the nowadays universal *Riverside Chaucer*--and Christopher Cannon and James Simpson, who are basing their upcoming *ombibus* Chaucer on Skeat's text.

Nevertheless, in spite of their benefits for the discipline as a whole, Furnivall's "printed" manuscripts have often been criticized for their editorial sloppiness. Against the judgment of many among his colleagues, Furnivall never attempted to produce actual critical editions--which he mockingly called "doctored editions"[^note_brandl]. On the contrary, committed to the rejection of all "doctoring," he strived to offer printed materials that would resemble the original sources as much as possible. Carolyn Dinshaw has stressed how Furnivall was frequently "ridiculed by medievalists more firmly esconced in the professional establishment" because of his "shoddy" editing habits and his employment of "nonspecialists" for editing tasks--in other words, how it was precisely the making of his "printed" manuscripts that earned him the label of "amateur."[^note_dinshaw] In his profile of Furnivall as a Chaucerian editor, Donald C. Baker zeroes in on some of the reasons behind this assessment. According to him, Furnivall's work as an editor "cannot really be evaluated, for he never, in a sense, *edited* anything"--he just "printed."

> Furnivall, as he tells us, aimed to reproduce the manuscript itself as closely as possible, expanding obvious abbreviations (with italics), but generally wherever there was a doubt about practice reproducing the brevigraphs used by the scribes with a variety of printed symbols. The appearance of the page [...] certainly gives an impression of scholarly impeccability. [...] The remarkable thing which I concluded was that, considering the amount of material, the errors are quite surprisingly few, and, more importantly, consist largely of inconsistencies in representing letters (*i-j*, *u-v*, etc.) and in expansions, all of which Furnivall freely admits in his *Temporary Prefaces*.[^note_baker_2]

For Baker, Furnivall's editions would not suggest amateurism because of their "errors," but because of their "inconsistencies." Rather than accuracy, his process lacked a unifying criterion. On the one hand, he wished to "reproduce the manuscript" as faithfully as possible, rendering many "brevigraphs" typographically and preserving some of the idiosyncrasies that characterize medieval spelling. On the other, he aspired "to make early English texts available for a wide range of readers to enjoy"[^note_dinshaw_2], thus "expanding obvious abbreviations" and paying great attention to the legibility of the text and to its general "appearance on the page." Thus, divided between scholarly demands and his ambitions to accommodate a broad audience, Furnivall neglected to establish a consistent set of principles to govern the fulcrum of his editorial process: his transcriptions.

[^note_dinshaw_2]: Dinshaw, Carolyn. *How Soon is Now?*, 27.

Indeed, not only does Furnivall fail to provide an account of the principles that have informed his transcriptions, but he appears to gloss over the practice of transcribing altogether, avoiding--in his *Temporary Preface to the Six-Text Edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales*--the verb "to transcribe" and its cognates. Instead, Furnivall always speaks of "printing": "print Manuscripts," "unprinted Manuscripts," "prints of Manuscripts".[^note_furnivall_2] These phrases well encapsulate his understanding of his editorial endeavor. He did not describe the production of these volumes as a careful, time-consuming process--one that might have involved substantial labor, a number of contentious decisions, and the possibility of error and bias; rather, he characterized it as an ostensibly straightforward transition from a handwritten to a typographical support. The distance between the two media is therefore flattened by the seemingly careless joining of the predicate "to print"--which of course evokes the arrangement of types and the operation of the printing press--with the direct object "manuscripts"--which unambiguously designates unique artifacts written by hand. Through this flattening, Furnivall foregrounds the automaticity and speed of the modern machine--"print" absorbs "Manuscripts," not vice versa--and conceals his own human intervention. Thanks to this technology, the "unprinted" is made "printed"; a procedure that seems as fast and as simple--in other words, as immediate--as the removal of the prefix "un."

[^note_furnivall_2]: Furnivall, Frederick James. *A Temporary Preface*, *passim*.

As it emphasizes the immediacy of print, Furnivall's account of his own method overlooks the role of transcription--the least immediate of its prerequisites. Since the inception of the printing press, in the second half of the 15th century, the transcription of handwritten characters into reproducible sequences of types has constantly involved complex processes of semiotic negotiation. In their essay on *The Coming of the Book*, Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin remark how the copiousness of signs deployed in medieval handwriting created a potential "drawback" for early printers, who painstakingly "imitated" the appearance of manuscripts by deploying "so many typographic signs."

>  The first printers cast letters joined by ligatures and used standard abbreviations (*a* [with line on top] for *an* or *am*; *q* for *quia*) so that there were many more typographic signs than there are today. It makes us wonder whether the gradual abandonment of the ligatures and abbreviations so common in the 15th and 16th centuries was not partly due to a wish to reduce the number of punches and matrices needed, one aspect of the tendency toward uniformity and simplification so characteristic of the evolution of the book.[^note_febvre]

The material constraints of print--its reliance on a finite number of types--produced a "tendency toward uniformity and simplification" that clashed against the timesaving strategies developed by medieval scribes: ligatures and abbreviations. This initial negotiation affected the subsequent history of both media; printers began adopting a more economical set of "punches and matrices," while medieval abbreviations gradually disappeared from common use. From the start, transcription from one medium to another has been shaped by technological limitations, human decisions, and an inevitable loss of information. Furnivall conceals the impact of all three, while leaving room for a largely unregulated--and, therefore, inconsistent--practice of transcription.

The *Canterbury Tales* that we read today

A long century of cultural and technological transformations separates the foundation of the original Chaucer Society, started in 1868, from that of the New Chaucer Society, started in 1979. The different rationales behind the establishment of these two organizations--among the most influential for the study of Middle English--further reflect a dramatic change in the field of medieval studies. On the one hand, the "New" Society has aspired "to promote interest in Chaucer and to advance Chaucer studies," particularly by means of "international congresses" where members can "exchang[*e*] ideas and techniques." On the other, the "old" Chaucer Society was established "to let the lovers and students of [*Chaucer*] see how far the best unprinted Manuscripts of his works differ from the printed texts." Put differently, while the New Society has concentrated on dialogue, the old Society relied on print. According to its founder, the industrious editor and promoter F. J. Furnivall, the circulation of previously "unprinted Manuscripts" would in fact fulfill a critical scholarly need.

> There are many questions of metre, pronunciation, orthography, and etymology yet to be settled, for which more prints of Manuscripts are wanted, and it is hardly too much to say that every line of Chaucer contains points that need reconsideration.

Furnivall planned to facilitate the "reconsideration" and the "settl[*ing*]" of these textual quandaries by issuing the "prints of Manuscripts" which were ostensibly most "wanted" by his contemporaries. As a consequence, he supervised the production and the circulation of many "printed" manuscripts from the Middle Ages--a titanic endeavor which indeed proved quite fruitful. According to a present-day scholar, "the selection and printing of this series of texts was the most important contribution by one man to the tradition of Chaucerian textual study."

Today, in spite of its undeniable scholarly usefulness, Furnivall's project of "print[*ing*] [...] Manuscripts" comes across as perplexing.

### Back to Diplomatic Transcription

1. Today we may hardly imagine a practice of medieval philology detached from the support of photography. As Ludwig Traube noted in 1909, it was thanks to the circulation of affordable photographic facsimiles that scholars of the Middle Ages could begin to compare the fine details of primary sources at their own pace, without the encumbrance of traveling from library to library. However, even before the popularization of photography, philologists did rely on surrogates--albeit of a different kind. To learn about a particular manuscript, a scholar who could not consult it in person would either turn to its description in a catalog, or confide in the accuracy of a typographic transcription. In fact, the scholarly need for such transcriptions motivated the editorial efforts of one among the most industrious champions of Chaucerian criticism: Frederick James Furnivall (1825-1910). During the last decades of the 19th century, Furnivall invested great labor and resources in producing transcriptions of previously unavailable medieval manuscripts, which he regarded as indispensable foundations for the study of premodern literature. Time proved him right. In the words of Donald C. Baker, "the selection and printing of this series of texts was the most important contribution by one man to the tradition of Chaucerian textual study." Furnivall's *Six-Text Edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales*--which appeared as an eighth-volume series of extravagantly "oblong folios," displaying his transcriptions from six different manuscripts in parallel columns--was extensively consulted by subsequent editors, including William W. Skeat--for his *The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*--and John Manly and Edith Rickert--editors of the seminal *Text of the Canterbury Tales*. In short, every modern edition of Chaucer's poem--including the ones that we read today--rests on the reliability and convenience of Furnivall's typographic transcriptions.

2. The practice of transcribing manuscripts typographically did not disappear with the inception of affordable photography. In fact, transcriptions are often included alongside photographic facsimiles--either digital or in print--to help readers find relevant passages within pages that may seem crammed or disorienting to the untrained eye. Paleographers and philologists still turn to transcription to zero in on the significant features that distinguish a particular variant. Critics like John Dagenais deploy faithful transcriptions of minute manuscript features in their essays, "to serve as a reminder that the material [*they*] cite is drawn from a medium radically different from the modern printed page on which we read it." Finally, students who learn how to read medieval handwriting are trained and tested through transcriptions, following the example established by their manuals and their teachers. Nevertheless, in spite of its past indispensability and present usefulness, the typographic transcription of medieval manuscripts has never been comprehensively systematized.

### Draft

#### Diplomatic Transcription

1. Having chosen a suitable manuscript for our project, and having selected an adequate range of pages and images for the training portion of our experiment, we then proceeded to produce our own transcriptions of the text contained in it. As we have mentioned, _kraken_ needs to be fed a relatively small collection of manual transcriptions, alongside the images from which these transcriptions are drawn. In our case, these transcriptions amounted to about 1,330 lines, distributed across 40 pages[^note_pages_lines]. By analyzing both these images and these transcriptions simultaneously, the software is supposed to develop its own set of instructions on how to extract editable strings of writing from sheer photographic reproductions. Accordingly, these training transcriptions must be prepared with great care. As expected, not only did the preparation of these manual transcriptions ultimately constitute the bulk of our work, but it also posed the largest number of challenges. More specifically, even though the manuscript on which the machine was trained--_Corpus Christi 198_--had already been edited by Frederick Furnivall in 1869, his 19th-century transcription proved unfit for our purposes. This happened because _kraken_--like most contemporary OCR systems--demands a "diplomatic transcription"; in other words, a transcription where every letter form represented on the page corresponds to a single character--or glyph--of plain text, abiding by a strict one-to-one correlation. On the contrary, Furnivall's transcription systematically expands most scribal abbreviations, causing incongruities between image and text that would inevitably compromise the training process.

[^note_pages_lines]: When compared with other contemporary OCR systems deployed for similar purposes, the training of a model through _kraken_ demands relatively few pages. The guidelines of _Transkribus_, for instance, recommend a training data set of about 100 pages.

2. As a consequence, even though we relied on Furnivall's work to verify the accuracy of our transcriptions, we assembled these 1,330 lines of training data from scratch, together with some 1,400 additional lines which we transcribed for testing purposes. Besides the obvious paleographical labor, this step entailed a great deal of preparatory planning and deliberation. These preliminary decisions revolved around the problematic delineation of what counts as a proper "diplomatic transcription" within this context. In particular, we needed a consistent set of instructions to specify how to render the letter forms represented on the page--and reproduced on the digital images--into a precise sequence of plain text characters; in other words, a reliable system of correspondences between handwritten letter forms and typographical glyphs. Given the current increase in the digitization of medieval manuscripts, and the proliferation of digital editions derived from them, one would be inclined to take the existence of such a standard for granted. Nevertheless, a precise and consistent set of guidelines concerning how to prepare a "diplomatic transcription" does not seem to exist yet--not even among paleographers[^note_lack_standard]. For this reason, every contemporary edition of a Middle English manuscript--either online or in print--must reinvent its own rules anew. This necessity becomes more prominent the more closely an editor strives to reproduce the original aspect of the handwritten page. Among the numberless features and distinctions that characterize the original codex, which ones should be preserved in this typographical reproduction, and how?

[^note_lack_standard]: Compare, for instance,  ...

3. Therefore, considering the ostensible lack of a consistent standard for "diplomatic transcriptions," and because of the restrictions imposed by the OCR system, we were faced with the question of how to translate these late medieval letter forms into plain text characters--preserving the one-to-one ratio demanded by _kraken_. Moreover, we decided to limit our selection of characters to the set that had been proposed in the guidelines of the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative[^note_mufi]. In particular, we followed their recommendations to render less common characters and abbreviations through dependable Unicode encodings, thus ensuring that these could be displayed adequately across different systems and applications. We sense that the decisions made during this phase of the training matter a great deal, since they become a defining component for the resulting model. For instance, should the machine learn the distinction between a long "s" (ſ) and a kidney-shaped "s" (ß)? Should it preserve the difference between an ampersand (&) and a tironian "et" (⁊)? Should it reproduce the contrast between a plain double "l" (ll) and a crossed--or "Welsh"--double "l" (ỻ)? Maintaining these distinctions may complicate the training and hinder the legibility of the final product; but ignoring them may cause a loss of information that the model will replicate in every subsequent implementation. In other words, the scholars who develop a model decide not only how the OCR system will acquire and interpret the training data, but also how every subsequent text processed by it will be read in the future.

[^note_mufi]: MUFI ...

4. Taking into account the lasting impact of these implementations, and the fact that individual models may become increasingly versatile as the research behind OCR advances, these decisions should be discussed thoroughly, and involve the participation of specialists from all the adjacent fields that rely on the analysis of such materials--not only paleographers and codicologists, but also linguists and literary critics. The potential scalability of this technology suggests that the outcome of these discussions will ultimately affect our study of these artifacts--including their editorial history and their language--for a very long time. From this standpoint, the current technological limitations of OCR may have caused an almost unprecedented disciplinary shift in the way we approach the relationship between medieval handwriting and its typographical reproduction. The successful training of these models will rest on the establishment of a shared and sustainable standard for "diplomatic transcription"; and this standard will demand an exact correspondence between handwritten letter forms and discrete digital encodings. In short, the imminent rise of OCR will compel scholars to reflect again on what features of a medieval script should be deemed essential for its fruition, and why. In the training of our model, for example, we chose to maintain the distinction between the plain double "l" and the Welsh double "l," but we ignored the one between short "s" and long "s." We came to this conclusion by assessing that the former carried semantic weight as an abbreviation for an unstressed "e," while the latter did not.

5. To facilitate the discussion surrounding these critical decisions, and to promote the creation of a shared and sustainable standard for "diplomatic transcriptions" within this context, we assembled and described all our choices in a comprehensive list which we made publicly available on our Git repository. ...
 Certainly, given its relatively small number of ligatures and abbreviations, a contemporary reader might find _Corpus Christi 198_ generally legible when compared with other handwritten documents from its period. To the human eye, its neatly arranged pages and generally distinct letter forms might recall the alleged tidiness of contemporary typesetting more than the _horror vacui_ popularly associated with the medieval book. Nevertheless, in spite of its ostensible legibility, the adaptation of this text into a digital "diplomatic transcription" entailed a number of choices ...

Optical Character Recognition and Middle English Manuscripts

Note: We’re currently intending to submit this article to Digital Philology (or a similar journal—Manuscript Studies might also work). This is a medievalist journal with a bent towards the digital humanities, which means the audience is largely medievalists who are interested in medieval digital projects. They’ve never had an article on OCR, but they’ve had articles on digital databases and tools (for example, this is an article on database for medieval Catalan songbooks). We’re assuming that the audience hasn’t heard of OCR but has familiarity with paleography.

To-Do List
[ ] Find out who has defined “diplomatic transcription” and how;
[ ] Find three examples of “diplomatic transcription,” show how it is inconsistent
[ ] Email KKF?
[ ] Look into the “data massaging” problem
[ ] Look at Ralph Hanna working on the Ellesmere (cutting away parts of the MS)
[ ] Look at Ker working on the Harley lyrics (multilingual transcr.)
[ ] Prepare preliminary draft / fleshed out outline

Highlight the decisions that went into the *massaging* of the image and the manuscript
Will OCR prompt us to use MSs that are deemed more “readable”? Moving away from decoration, stains, rips…? (bias)

1.1 Problem of Limited Manuscript Transcriptions
In the past few decades, the field of medieval studies has been greatly affected by the rise of digital editions and the increased availability of online facsimiles. Thanks to comprehensive databases, students and scholars of the Middle Ages can now easily access hundreds of digitized manuscripts and thousands of high-quality images. The number of digital preservation projects are steadily increasing, with libraries and universities scanning and uploading new images every year. On a smaller scale, the proliferation of portable photographic devices, particularly in the form of digital cameras and smartphones, has enabled researchers to photograph, upload and share manuscript pages almost effortlessly, resulting in the informal -an latent circulation of archival material that has similarly affected the field. We look at these images constantly; they appear on the screens of our classrooms, in those of conference rooms, and on our own laptops. However, in spite of these technological advancements and of this steady increase in digital preservation, the dissemination of these images has not radically transformed the way we approach them. Since the inception of digitization, critics have repeatedly speculated on how technology would allow us to challenge the artificial dichotomy between manuscript and text—they predicted that medievalists would soon complement their reliance on reconstructed critical editions with a constant perusal of digitally available primary sources. So far, this prediction has not been fulfilled. On most occasions, we still treat these images as facsimiles—items that we look at rather than texts that we read.
The distinction between looking and reading has been overcome more easily in other fields. For instance, comprehensive databases of printed materials—such as HathiTrust, the Internet Archive, or Google Books—allow scholars to look up strings of text across millions of digitized books. Such opportunities are not limited to modern texts; on the contrary, databases such as EEBO—Early English Books Online—allow scholars to perform analogous searches and inquiries on thousands of printed materials published between 1473 and 1700. Since the search engine can locate the specific paragraph and line where a string appears on a facsimile, users can then seamlessly examine the actual layout of the page, verify the presence of illustrations or annotations, and perhaps flip the book back and forth.
With corresponding transcriptions for digital medieval manuscripts, researchers could search and read digital facsimiles with relative ease, closing the gap between looking and reading. Producing transcriptions for a large corpus of medieval manuscripts would serve additional purposes beyond the digital facsimile experience. It would allow us to compare manuscripts across a single textual tradition, create digital editions for lesser-known texts, and conduct large-scale data analysis (such as topic modelling and text mining) across historical documents. Projects like the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, which has produced digital transcriptions of eight B-Text manuscripts, attest to the usefulness of an easily accessible, readable, and usable digital archive. However, human transcription is time-consuming and expensive: it requires a trained paleographer and hours of labor per manuscript.
Fortunately, machine learning can help solve this problem by producing automatic transcriptions en-masse. Specifically, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), a method of turning print or handwriting into digital text, can allow researchers to automatically convert images of manuscripts into digital transcriptions. In the past two years, researchers have begun training OCR models on medieval scripts: most notably, Tobias Hodel and his Transkribus team have been using OCR technology to transcribe German and Latin Gothic scripts. Our team wanted to determine whether we could train a machine to transcribe a Middle English script and understand the challenges involved with this kind of project.
 Using an open-source OCR system called Kraken, developed by Ben Kiessling at the University of Leipzig, our team has promisingly trained an OCR system to transcribe manuscripts of the 14th century Middle English Scribe D. While much work remains to be done before this technology can accurately transcribe most medieval scripts, these initial results at least indicate that with more training data and more advanced machine learning systems, OCR may very well have an immense impact on medieval studies. In this article, we discuss our methodology, results, and important considerations for future manuscript OCR projects.

2. Methodology

2.1 OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) transforms a text-image—for example a scanned book or a photograph of a document—into machine-readable text. This conversion process allows print and handwritten texts to be digitally searched, edited, stored, and otherwise manipulated by a computer. OCR technology already underlies many of the digital texts we read: it is what enables Project Gutenberg to easily digitize printed texts and Google Books to perform keyword-searches on scanned books. OCR models are built through machine learning, meaning that the machine executes tasks through inferred rules rather than explicit instruction. For example, in the case of manuscript transcription, a machine is first given images of a manuscript alongside corresponding digital transcriptions, the machine next “trains” on the images and transcriptions and “learns” the transcription rules on its own, and the machine then produces its own transcriptions on new, previously unseen images.
MUnfortunately, medieval manuscripts pose significant challenges to automated processing. Unlike printed texts, medieval handwriting often contains non-discrete characters, for example in the conjoined letters of cursive scripts or the disconnected minims of Gothic script; machines cannot simply be taught individual letter forms, but must learn tothe transcribe larger segments of text. Compared to modern handwritten documents, medieval manuscripts feature elaborate and often cryptic handwriting systems which vary intensely across period, region, and scribe. Accordingly, distinct OCR systems must be trained on distinct medieval scripts, which means compiling training data on tens, if not hundreds, of manuscripts per script. Furthermore, medieval manuscripts often have extensive marginal notes, decorations, and damage, making it difficult to distinguish text from other information in a digital image. Finally, given that the most advanced OCR engines often rely on comprehensive dictionaries and natural language processing to improve accuracy, the inconsistent orthography of medieval languages (like Middle English or Old French) poses an additional obstacle to efficient automated transcription.
In order to assess the feasibility and scalability of automatic transcription for medieval manuscripts, we decided to experiment with a pre existent OCR software—Kraken—on a small corpus of Middle English manuscripts. Kraken is a turn-key OCR software developed by Ben Kiessling, originally created to transcribe Arabic texts. Conventional OCR systems operate by learning individual letter forms, but since Arabic is a connected script, it requires a system that transcribes larger strings of text. Kraken uses a neural network to recognize text without first segmenting it into words and letters, and has proven very effective at transcribing Arabic. Since medieval handwriting often features  non-discrete letter forms, and therefore poses similar challenges as connected scripts, we decided that Kraken would be a fitting program to use. Kraken has the added benefit of being completely open-source, so we could experiment with our models without waiting for another team or company to run the training for us.

2.2 Corpus

When selecting manuscripts for training and testing, we aimed for a script that was both widespread and exemplary. That is, we sought a handwriting system which was used to write many of the manuscripts in Middle English that survive to this day, which shared individual traits with other scripts, and whose general aspect—or ductus—could serve as a medial point between several chronologically adjacent scripts. Anglicana Formata suited this description..As is well known, this script was developed in the second half of the 13th century as a sort of functional yet relatively elegant book hand; it could be written more easily and rapidly than Gothic textualis, but it looked more legible and polished than a documentary cursive. For this reason, Anglicana Formata became a standard for medium and high-end Middle English manuscripts; after 1375, it proved instrumental for the exponential increase in the insular production of vernacular books. Moreover, it encompassed letter forms drawn from older scripts, such as Gothic and documentary, and from newer scripts, such as Secretary. Finally, the automatic transcription of its ductus poses challenges shared with other scripts; for instance, it combines the loops and slants of documentary with the minims and compressions of Gothic.
Having chosen Anglicana Formata, we then selected the manuscripts that would comprise our small corpus. We decided to focus this corpus around a particular scribe and to his professional circle: "Scribe D"—possibly John Marchaunt—and the scribes involved in the production of the Trinity Confessio Amantis (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.2). In particular, we trained the machine on a manuscript that was attributed to Scribe D (Oxford, Corpus Christi Coll., MS 198), which is particularly clean document with a neat script  (see “Conclusions 4.3” for further discussion). For resting manuscripts, we aspired to concentrate on scribal differences alone; to minimize the effect of other factors, these hands should have shared a common script, and a similar historical and geographical background. We tested the resulting model on four other manuscripts: two attributed to him (the Trinity Confessio Amantis itself; and London, Brit. Lib., MS Harley 7334), one attributed to Scribe B—possibly Adam Pinkhurst—(Cambridge, Trinity College, B.15.17), and one by an Anonymous scribe (Corpus Christi 201). We selected these particular manuscripts because we hoped to assess extent a machine trained on the hand of one scribe could also satisfactorily transcribe texts written in a different hand. Because of the well-attested collaboration within the group of scribes to which Scribe D belonged, we could assume a spatial and chronological proximity between him and Scribe B, and—perhaps—an attempt to uniform their script. We also decided to experiment with a scribe outside this professional circle whose hand is still Anglicana Formata; therefore we added Corpus Christi 201, whose scribal hand is significantly different from Scribe D and his professional circle, even if he is writing in the same time period in the same general script.
2.2 Training Procedure
    After selecting our training manuscript (Corpus Christi MS 198), we first compiled our training data—1,330 lines from the manuscript transcribed in plain text. These lines were selected from a range of the manuscript with no major damage or decoration. We consulted a print transcription for reference and thoroughly double-checked our transcriptions. Since Kraken requires fully diplomatic transcriptions, we also had to devise systematic Unicode characters for abbreviations (this step will be further discussed in our “Conclusions”). We then trained our model by providing Kraken with scans of the manuscript pages alongside our digital transcriptions.

3. Results

3.1 First Round

After Kraken had completed its training, we tested our model on the training pages, new pages from the same manuscript, and pages from additional manuscripts (see Table 1). Our model did better than expected on the training pages (9.83% error rate), as well as on unseen pages from the same manuscript (14.64% error rate). Our model also did relatively well on other manuscripts from Scribe D. As to be expected, it performed better on Scribe D’s Harley 7334 (another Canterbury Tales manuscript) than his pages of Trinity R.3.2 (a Confessio Amantis manuscript).
Our model performed poorly on manuscripts from other scribes. It performed particularly poorly (82.56% error rate) with the scribal hand of Corpus Christi 201 (a scribe outside D’s professional circle) and relatively better (41.45%) with Scribe B (a scribe in his professional circle). Nevertheless, our Scribe D model appears to be constrained to Scribe D forms and cannot produce significantly accurate transcriptions of other scribes.
When we examine the model’s success at transcribing individual characters, we find that, for the most part, the model does best with high frequency characters—this is to be expected, since the model will better learn characters that appear more often. For example, the model does relatively poorly with capitals (“B” has a 31.82% error rate, “O” has a 36.84% error rate, “S” has a 33.33% error rate), and relatively well with minuscules (“b” has a 13.9% error rate, “o” has a 13.23% error rate, and “s” has a 13.17% error rate). Characters that are typically difficult for humans to discern also prove difficult for our machine. For example, the model does relatively poorly with characters prone to minim confusion: “i” has a 26.94% error rate (even though it occurs very frequently) and “m” has a 29% error rate. Looking at the individual character error rates may also reveal certain training biases: for example, our model does unusually well with “P” (9.09% error rate) compared to other capitals (average error rate), perhaps because we trained the model on a selection from the Knight’s Tale, in which Palamon is a titular character. Training models on a more diverse selection of texts may even out some of these training biases.

4. Conclusions

When we started this project, we knew of no other team working on medieval script recognition. Since we’ve been working on the project, other teams have been successfully training OCR models on medieval scripts, such as the Transkribus team headed by Tobias Hodel, which works on German and Latin scripts. Even though other research teams have been achieving similar results, we think it’s important to discuss the challenges we faced in throughout this project.

4.1 Abbreviations

During training, Kraken and other OCR programs require diplomatic transcriptions which reproduce all the characters in a manuscript image. As a result, abbreviations in medieval scripts pose a significant challenge for generating training transcriptions. Even if a digital transcription of a manuscript is available (which is often not the case), most “diplomatic” transcriptions extend abbreviations in italics, which the machine cannot recognize. Therefore researchers must compile transcriptions manually. In addition, digital transcriptions must be in Unicode, and there is currently no Unicode standard for medieval abbreviations, nor are medieval abbreviations typically rendered in Unicode at all. Researchers therefore need to decide how to render each abbreviation in Unicode (for example, “d̉ ” instead of “der”). This is particularly difficult for Middle English, which has no paleographic handbook for abbreviations (such as Capelli serves for medieval Latin). Therefore not only did we have to select Unicode characters for each abbreviation, we also had to categorize the abbreviations in the first place. We currently have a working abbreviation guide (available on GitHub) that outlines our abbreviation categories and corresponding Unicode characters. In order for this technology to accurately and optimally render medieval scripts, researchers and paleographers will need to collaborate to decide on universal Unicode characters for abbreviations. As a universal tool will require consistent training data from different research teams, it is necessary that we decide on standard transcription decisions, such as abbreviations.

4.2 Different Scribe, Script, and Language Models

We trained our model on a single scribe and a single manuscript, but future projects should experiment with models trained on different manuscripts and different scribes. A useful automatic transcription tool will need to successfully read different scribes; it will be too time consuming to have models for every single Middle English scribe.

Additional experiments can also be performed with multi-script models (for example, Anglicana Formata and Secretary). However, it is more reasonable to have models for individual scripts than models for individual scribes. Researchers have already been experimenting with using OCR to identify script types. It is therefore not hard to imagine a machine that first uses OCR to recognize the script type, selects the relevant script model, and finally uses that OCR model to transcribe the image.
CB highlights that multi-script models would be useful for the same MS as well; perhaps it would be useful to train model on the “hierarchy of scripts” of a single MS.

Finally, experiments should be performed with multilingual models. We limited our model to Middle English by training with a Canterbury Tales manuscript, but many “Middle English” manuscripts are actually multilingual (e.g. with Latin glosses). We hypothesize that script is the primary limiting factor for models; in other words, that as long as both Latin and Middle English are written in Anglicana Formata, a machine can learn the graphs in both languages simultaneously. But multilingual training may pose new challenges and lower accuracy rates, which would be critical hurdles to overcome.

More emphasis on multiple languages?

4.3 Script and Manuscript Quality

We also trained our model on an especially neat scribe and a clean manuscript with little decoration and damage. But most medieval manuscripts have either sloppier handwriting, difficult minim sequences, marginalia, illuminations, rips, stains, or other non-textual features. Since Kraken automatically recognizes and segments lines in a manuscript image, these features can prevent or confuse line recognition and ultimately prevent accurate transcription. Future experiments should be performed with manuscripts containing these non-textual features and with programs that can distinguish text from other features in a manuscript image.

4.3 Different OCR Systems

Since Kraken is open-source, it is easy for researchers to use and allows flexibility in training. This allows you to easily experiment with amount of training data, different models generated from training, color, manuscripts, etc (fix).  But we also plan to experiment with different OCR systems. Another OCR project, Transkribus, is working to build a large corpus of training data and incorporate many different scripts and languages. They also have a separate team which handles the training, which means medievalists need to do even less computer-work. The drawback of this workflow is that it makes it harder for individual researchers to experiment with training.

4.4 Open-source and open-access  

Most importantly, it’s essential that all researchers working on automatic transcription projects make their training data and OCR models freely available online. This way researchers can experiment with new OCR systems, collectively generate a large corpus of training manuscripts, and use trained OCR models for various transcription projects.

Relatedly, training a transcription machine requires digital images of manuscripts. Luckily thousands of medieval manuscripts are fully digitized, and future digitization projects will provide more candidates for training and transcriptions. However, even though many manuscripts are digitized and available to view online in high-resolution, most libraries do not allow these images to be downloaded in high-resolution, which is required for the training process. Even in our relatively small experiment, we were extremely limited by the manuscript images freely available to download and those which libraries agreed to send us. While institutions may not want to make these images publically available, they will need to share them with researchers if they want a tool which will significantly improve their digital editions in the long run.
