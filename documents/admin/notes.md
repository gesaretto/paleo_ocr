Meeting with Chris 6.26

- Look into Thomas Aquinas handwriting, mostly wrote on wax tablets and so very messy
  - someone has been trying to train a computer to read this
- For funding:
  - always good to show widespread applicability (not just english, not just this script)
- Abbreviations:
  - so often individual to scribe, not standard
- Uppercase:
  - small stroke
- Look into medieval academy and NEH for grants
- Look into BL for digitizing manuscript price (can digitize from microfilm)
