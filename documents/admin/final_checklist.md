- [ ] Fix the citations that are marked in the Google Doc article.

- [ ] Organize GitHub directory.

- [ ] Make a DOI.

- [ ] Check about table.
    - [ ] Potentially create table in PanDoc.

- [ ] Check for double negatives.

- [ ] Make the language about "rapidity," "automaticity," "scale," "speed..." consistent.

- [ ] Tighten up para. 1 of page 3 (about Furnivall).

- [ ] Get rid of "to be" constructions (that is, of the verb "to be" altogether).

- [ ] Cite others on "remediation" when we cite Grusin.

- [ ] Make methodology explicit (why do we go to our process in such detail; provide rationale for the thorough exposition of process).

- [ ] Double check and potentially remove the terms "text-image" and "turn-key" (people may not know what that means).

- [ ] Be consistent with words in quotes (especially around pp. 5 and 6).

- [ ] Pick stronger verbs throughout.

- [ ] Use more technical language (especially in the "methods" section).
