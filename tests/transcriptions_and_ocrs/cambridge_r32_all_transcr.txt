Of holy contemplacion̄

Of maister Cerimon þe leche

But eu̔y man haþ what he wolde
The king as he wel couþe he scholde
Makþ to his poeple right good chier̉
And aftir sone as þou schalt hiere
A ꝑlement he haþ somoned
wher he his doughter haþ coroned

and seide þat he wolde wende
To Tharse for to make an ende
Of þat his doughter was betraied
wher of were all men wel paied
And seide how it was for to done

A strong power with him he took

And seih þe wynd was couenable

And seilen til þey come alonde

Touching his doughter as þe herde
And whan þey wiste how it ferde
As he which pees and loue soughte

To don him right in iuggement
Anon þey weren boþe assent

And as hem þoughte it was to done

And þurgh mercy sauf is simplesse
Of hire whom mercy p̔serueþ
Thus haþ he wel þat wel deserueþ
Whan al þis þing is don and ended
This king which loued was and frended
A lettre haþ which cam to him
Be schipe fro Pentapolim
In which þe lond haþ to him write

how in good mynde and in good pees
Ded is þe king Artestrates

That he þe lettre wol resceyue and come his regne to receyue

And þis besoughten þe comune

This king seih how it was bifalle

and goþ him in to schip ayein
The wynd was good þe see was plein
hem nedeþ nought a rif to slake
Til þey Pentapolim haue take
The lond which herde of þat tydinge
was wondir glad of his comynge
he refteþ him a day or tuo
And tok his counseil to him þo
And sette a time of ꝑlemēt
wher al þe lond of on assent
fforth with his wijf haþ him coroned
wher alle good him was foisoned
lo what it is to be wel grounded
ffor he haþ first his loue founded
honestely as for to wedde
honestely his loue he spedde
and hadde children with his wijf
and as him luste he ladde his lijf
And in ensample his lijf was write
þat alle louers mighten wite
how atte laste it schal be sene
Of loue what þey wolden meene
ffor se now on þat oþ̔ side
Antiochus wiþ al his pride
which sette his loue vnkyndely
his ende hade sodeinly.
Sett ayein kinde vppon vengance
And for his lust haþ his penance
Lo þus my sone might þou liere
what is to loue in good maner̉
and what to loue in oþ̔wise
The meede arist of þe seruise
ffortune þough sche be not stable
yit at som time is fauorable
To hem þat ben of loue trewe
But certes it is for to rewe
To se loue ayein kinde falle
ffor þat makþ sore aman to falle
As þou might of tofore rede
ffor þy my sone I wolde rede
To lete all oþer loue aweie
But if it be þurgh such a weie
As loue and resoun wolde acorde
ffor elles if þat þou descorde
And take lust as doþ a beste
Thy loue may nought ben honeste
ffor be no skile þat I fynde
Such lust is nought of loues kynde
My fader how so þat it stonde
youre tale is herd and vnderstonde
as þing which worþi is to hiere
Of gret ensample and gret matier̉
wher of my fader god yow quite
But in þis point my self aquite
I may right wel þat neu̔e yit
I was assoted in my witt
But only in þat worþi place
wher alle lust and alle g̃ce
Is sett. if þat daunger ne were
But þat is al my moste fere
I not what ye fortune accompte
But what þing daunger may amonnte
I wot wel for I haue assaied
ffor whan mȳ herte is best araied
And I haue al my witt þorgh sought
Of loue to beseche hire ought
ffor al þat eu̔e I sike may
I am concluded wiþ a nay
þat oo sillable haþ ouer þrowe
A þousand wordes on a rowe
Of suche as I best speke can
Thus am I but a lewed man
But fader for ye ben a clerk
Of loue. and þis matier is derk
And I can eu̔e leng þe lasse
But yit I may not lete it passe
youre hole counseil I beseche
þat ye me be som weye teche
what is my beste as for an ende
My sone vnto þe trouþe wende.
Now wol I for þe loue of þe
And lete all oþre trifles be
The more þat þe nede is hih
The more it nedeþ to be slih.
To him which haþ þe nede on honde
I haue wel herd and vnderstonde
My sone al þat þou hast me said
and ek of þat þou hast me praid
Now at þis time þat I schal
As for conclusion final
Counseil vppon þy nede sette
So þenke I finally to knette
Thy cause wher it is tobroke
and make an ende of þat is spoke
ffor I behighte þe þat þifte
fferst whan þou com vndir my schrifte
þat þough I toward Venus were
yit spak I suche wordes þere
þat for þe p̔stode which I haue
myn ordre and myn astat to saue
I seid I wolde of myn office
To v̉tu more þan to vice
Encline. and teche þe my lore
ffor þy to speken ou̔more
Of loue which þe may auaile
Tak loue wher it may auaile
ffor as of þis which þou art Inne
Be þat þou seist it is a synne
and synne may no pris deserue
wiþoute pris and who schal serue
I not what ꝓfit might auaile
Thus folweþ it if þou trauaile
wher þou no ꝓfit hast ne pris
Thou art toward þiself vnwis
and siþþe þou mightest lust atteyne
Of eu̔y lust þe ende is peyne
And eu̔y peyne is good to flee
So is it wonder þing to see
why such a þing schal be desired
þe more þat a stok is fired
þe raþere in to aisshe it torneþ
The foot which in þe were sporneþ
ffulofte his hed haþ ou̔throwe
þis loue is blind and can nought knowe
wher þat he goþ til he be falle
ffor þi but if it so bifalle
wiþ good counseil þat he be lad
him oughte for to ben adrad
ffor counseil passeþ all þing
To him which þenkþ to ben a king
and eu̔y man for his partie
A kingdom haþ to iustifie
þat is to seie his oughne doom
If he misrewele þat kingdoom
he leeseþ himself and þat is more
Than if he loste schipp and oore
And al þe worldes good wiþ al
ffor what mā þat in special
he nought himself he haþ nought elles
Nomore þe perles þan þe schelles
Al is to him of oo Value
þough he hadde at his retenue
The wide world right as he wolde
whan he his herte haþ nought wiþholde
Toward himself. al is in vein
and þus my sone I wolde sein
As I seide er þat þou arise
Er þat þou falle in such a wise
þat þou ne might þiself recouer̉
ffor loue which þat blind was euer̉
Makþ all his ẜuantz blinde also
My sone and if þou haue ben so
yit is it tyme to wiþdrawe
and sett þin herte vnder þat lawe.
The which of reson̄ is gouerned.
and nought of will and to be lerned
Ensamples þou hast many on
Of now and ek of tyme agon
That eu̔y lust is but a while
and who þat wole himself beguyle
he may þe raþer be deceyued
My sone now þou hast conceyued
Som what of þat I wolde meene
hier aftirward it schal be seene
If þat þou lerne vpon my lore
ffor I can do to þe nomore
But teche þe þe righte weie
and ches if þou wilt liue or deie
My fader so as I haue herd
youre tale but it were answerd
I were mochil for to blame
My wo to yow is but a game

The feeling of a mannes heele
May nought be likned to þe herte
I may nought þough I wolde asterte
And ye be fre from al þe peyne
Of loue. wher of I me pleyne
It is right esy to comānde.

Nought of an oxe what him eyleþ
It falleþ ofte a man merueileþ
Of þat he seþ anoþer fare
But if he knewe himself þe fare
and felte it as it is in soth
he scholde do right as he doþ
Or elles worse in his degre
ffor wel I wot and so do ye
That loue haþ eue̔ yit ben vsed
So moot I nedes ben excused
But fader if ye wolde þus
vnto Cupide and to venus
Be frendlich vnto my querele
So þat mȳ herte were in hele
Of loue which is in my brest
I wot wel þanne a bettre p̔st
was neu̔e mad to my behoue
But al þe while þat I houe
In non̄certein bituen þe tuo
And not wher I to wel or wo
Schal torne. þat is al my drede
So þat I not what is to red
But for final conclusion̄
I þenke a supplicacioun
wiþ pleyne wordes ⁊ exp̔sse

þe which I prie yow to bere
And bringe ayein a good answere
Tho was betwen my prest and me

That he haþ seid but nought for þy
My will haþ no þing sett þ̔by

My prest and I but I spak fair̉

Thanne atte laste þey acorden
So þat he seith he wol recorden
To speke and stonde vppō my side
To Venus boþe and to Cupide
And bad me write what I wolde
And seiþ me trewely þat he scholde
My lettre bere vnto þe queene
And I sat doun Vppon þe grene
ffulfild of loues fantasie
And with þe teeres of mȳ yhe
In stede of enke I gan to write
The wordes whiche I wole endite
vnto Cupide and to Venus
And in my lettre I seide thus
The woful peyne of loues maladie
Ayein þe which may no phisiqꝫ auaile
Min herte haþ so bewhaped wiþ sotie
þat wher so þat I reste or trauaile
I fynde it eu̔e redy to assaile
My reson̄ which þat can him nought defende
Thus seche I helpe wher of I mighte amende
First to nature if þat I me compleyne
Ther fynde I how þat eu̔y creature
Som tyme a yeer haþ loue in his demeyne
So þat þe litel wrenne in his mesur̉
haþ yit of kinde of loue vnder his cure
And I but o desir of which I misse
And þus but I haþ eu̔y kinde his blisse
The reson̄ of my witt it ouerpasseþ
Of þat nature techeþ me þe weie.
To loue. and yit no certein sche cōpasseþ
how I schal spede and þus betuen þe tweie

ffor þough treson̄ ayein my wil debate
I may nought fle þat I ne loue algate
Uppon my self is þilke tale come

ffor euer I wrastle and eu̔e I am behinde

Whom nedeþ helpe he mot his helpe cũe
Or helpeles he schal his neede spille
Pleinly þorghout my wittes all I haue
But non of hem can helpe aftir my wille
And als so wel I mighte sitte stille
As preie vnto my lady eny helpe
Thus woot I nought wherof my self to yelpe

To do me g̃ce of þilke sweete tonne

Aftir þe sentence of þy bille
þou most þ̔of don at my wille
And I þerof me wole auyse
ffor be þou hool it schal suffise
nought al as þou desire woldest
But so as þou be resōn scholdest
Venus which stant wiþoute lawe
In no certein but as men drawe
Of Raggemā vpon þe chānce
Sche leiþ no peis in þe balānce
But as hire likeþ for to weie
þe trewe man fulofte aweie
Sche put. which haþ hire grace bede
and set an vntrewe in his stede
lo þus blindly þe world sche demeþ
In loues cause as to me semeþ
I not what oþre mē wolde sein
But i algate am so besein
And stonde as on amonges all
which am out of hir grace fall
It nedeþ take no witnesse
ffor sche which seid is þe goddesse
To wheþer part of loue it wende
haþ set me for a final ende
The point wherto þat I schal holde
ffor whan sche hath me wel beholde
haluynge of scorn sche seide þus
þou wost wol þat I am Venus
which al only my lustes seche
And well I wot þough þou beseche
My loue. lustes be þer none
which I may take in þy ꝑsone
My loue lust. and lokkes hore
In chambre acorden neu̔e more
and þough þou feigne a yong corrage
It scheweþ wel be þe visage
þat olde Grisell is no fole
Ther ben ful many yeeres stole
wiþ þe and suche oþre mo
þat outward feignen youthe so
And ben wiþinne of poure assay
Myn herte wolde and I ne may
Is nought beloued now a dayes
Er þou make eny suche assaies
To loue. and faile vppon þe fet
Bettre is to make a beau retret
ffor þough þou mightest loue atteyne
yit were it but an ydel peyne
whan þat þou art not sufficant
To holde loue his couenant
ffor þy tak hom þin herte ayein
þat þou trauaile nought in Vein
wher of my court may be deceyued
I wot and haue wel conceyued
how þat þy wille is good ynough
But more behoueþ to þe plough
wherof þe lackeþ as I trowe
So sit it wel þat þou beknowe
þy feble estat er þou begynne
þing wher þou might non ende wynne
what bargayn schulde a man assaie
whan þat him lackeþ for to paie
My sone is þat þou wel be þought
This toucheþ þe foryet it nought
