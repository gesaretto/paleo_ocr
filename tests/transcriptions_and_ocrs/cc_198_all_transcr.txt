And so do men if I þe soþe seye schal
loke who þat is most pacient in loue
he is at his auauntage aboue
Pacience is an heih vertu certeyn
ffor it venquissheþ as þese clerkes seyn
Thynges þat Rigor schulde neuer atteigne
ffor euery word men may nouȝt chyde ne pleyne
lerneþ to suffre or elles so mote I gon
ȝe schullen it lerne wheþer ȝe wole or non
ffor in þis worlde certeyn no wight nys
þat he ne doþ or saiþ sumtyme amys
Or oþir siknesse oþer constillacion̄
wyn wo or chaungyng of complexion̄
Causeþ ful often to don amys oþer speken
On euery wrong men may nouȝt ben awreken
After þe tyme moste be temꝑaunce
To euery wight þat can no gouernance
And þerfore haþ þis worþy wise knight
To lyue in ese suffraunce hire behight
And sche to him ful wisly gan to swere
That neuer schulde þer be defaute in here
here may men sen an humble wyse acord
Thus haþ sche take hire seruan̄t and hire lord
Seruaunt in loue and lord in mariage
Then was he boþe in lordschipe and ẜuage
Seruage nay but in lordschipe aboue
Seþyns þat he haþ boþe his lady and his loue
his lady certes and his wyf also
The whiche þat lawe of loue acordeþ þer to
And whan he was in þis ꝓsꝑite
home wiþ his wyf he goþ to his cuntre
Nouȝt fer fro pedmark þer as his dwellyng was
wher as he lyueþ in blisse and in solas
who couþe telle but he hadde wedded be
þe ioye þe ese and þe ꝓsperite
That is bitwixe an housebond and his wyf
A ȝeer and more lasted þis blisful lijf
Til þat þis knight of which I spak of þus
þat of kynrede was cleped arneragus
Schope him to gon and dwelle a ȝeer or tweyne
In engelond þat cleped eek was bretayne
To seche in armes worschipe and eek honõ
ffor all his lust he sette in such labour
And dwelleþ þere þe book saiþ þus
Now wol I stynte of þis arneragus
And speken I wole of dorygen his wijf
þat loueþ hir housbonde as hire hertes lyf
And for his absens wepeþ sche and sikeþ
As don þese noble wyues when hem likeþ
Sche mourneþ wakeþ wayleþ fasteþ ⁊ pleyneþ
Desire of his p̔sence hire so destreyneþ
That all þis wyde world sche sette at nouȝt
hire freendes which þat knewe hire heuy þouȝt
Conforted hire in al þat euer þey mighte or may
They prechen hire þay tellen hire night and day
þat causeles sche sleeþ hire self allas
And eu̔y confort possible in þis cas
þey don to hire wiþ all here busynes
And all to make hire lete hir heuynes
By ꝓcesse as ȝe knowe wel eu̔ychon
Men may so longe grauen in þe ston
Til som figure þ̔inne enprentyd be
Solonge han þey conforted hire þat sche
Receyued haþ by hope and by reson̄
The empryntyng of hir constillacion̄
Thurgh which hire grete sorwe gan aswage
Sche may nought alway endure in such a rage
And eek arneragus in al þis care
haþ sent his ꝉres home in al þis fare
And þat he wolde come hastly aȝayn
Oþer hadde þis sorwe hire herte slayn
hire frendes sawe hire herte gan to slake
And preyed hire on knees for goddes sake
To come and rome hire in companye
Away to dryue hire derke fantasye
And fynally sche gũnted þat requeste
ffor wel sche sawe it was for þe beste
Now stood hire castel faste by þe see
And often wiþ hire freendes walked sche
hire to disporte on þe banke on heih
wher as sche many schippe and barge seih
Seylinge here cours where hem luste to go
But ȝit was þere a parcelle of hir wo
ffor to hir self fuloften seyde sche
Is þer no schipp of so many as I se
wole brynge home my lord þen wolde myn herte
Al waryssche of þis bitter peynes smerte
Anoþer tyme þer wole sche sitte and þinke
And caste hire eyen dounward fro þe brynke
But whan sche saugh þe grisly rokkes blake
ffor verray fere so wolde hire herte quake
þat on hire feet sche mighte nought hire sustene
Thenne wolde sche sitte a doun vpon þe grene
And pitously in to þe see byholde
And sayn right þus wiþ sorowful hertes colde
Eterne god þat þurgh þy puruyaunce
ledest þe world by certein gou̔naunce
In ydelnesse as men sayn ȝe no þing make
But lord þese grisely feendly rokkes blake
That semen raþer a foul confusion̄
Of werk þen any fayr creacion̄
Of whiche a parfyt god and a stable
why han ȝe wrouȝt þis werk vnresonable
ffor by þis werke south north est and west
Ther nys y fostred man ne bryd ne best
hit doþ no good to my witt but annoyeþ
Se ȝe nouȝt lorde how mankynde it destroyeþ
An hundreþ þousand bodyes of mankynde
han rokkes slayn al be þey nouȝt in mynde
which mankynde is a fair part of þy werk
That þou it madest y like to þin hond werk
Thenne semed it ȝe hadde a gret chierte
Toward mankynde byt how þan may it be
That ȝe suche menys make it to distroyen
whiche menys doþ no good but euer annoyen
I wot wel clerkes woln sayn as hem leste
By argumentz þat al þing is for þe beste
Though I ne can þe causes for soþe knowe
but þilke god þat made wynd to blowe
as kepe my lord þis is my conclusion̄
To clerkes lete I al disputacion̄
But wolde god þat all þe rokkes blake
were sonken in to helle for his sake
There rokkes sleen mȳ herte for feere
Thus wolde sche sayn with many a pitous teere
hire freendes sawe þat nas no disport
To romen by þe see but discomfort
And schopen for to pleyen som where elles
þey leden hire by Ryueres and by welles
And eek in oþer places delitables
þey daunce and pleye at Chesse and at tables
So on a day right on þe morne tyde
vnto a gardyne þat was right þere besyde
In which þat þay hadde made here ordynance
Of vitaile and of oþer puruyaunce
They gon and pleyen hem al þe longe day
And þis was on þe sixte morwe of may
Which may hadde peynted wiþ his softe schoures
This gardyn ful of leues and of floures
And wiþ crafte of mannes hande so curiously
Arayed haþ þis gardyn trayelly
That neuer nas þer gardyn of such prys
But if it were þe verrey paradys
The odure of floures and þe freisshe sight
wolde han made ony pensyf herte light
That euer was born but if to gret siknesse
Oþer to gret sorwe hyld it in distresse
And after dynere gan þey to daunce
So ful it was of beaute with plesaunce
And synge also but dorigen allone
Sche made alwey hire compleynt and hire mone
ffoor sche ne saugh him on þe daunce go
þat was hire housbond and hir loue also
But naþeles sche moste a tyme abyde
And with good hope sche let hir sorwe glyde
vpon þis daunce amonges oþer men
Daunced a squier biforen Dorigen
That freisscher was and iolyer of array
As to my dome þan is þe monþe of May
he syngeþ and daunceþ passyng any man
That is or was siþenes þis world bygan
There wiþ he was if men schulde him discryue
On þe beste farynge man on lyue
ȝong strong right vertuous riche and wys
And wel biloued and holden in gret prys
And schortliche if þe soþe telle I schal
vnwytyng of þis Dorigen at al
This lusty squyer ẜuaunt to venus
which þat y cleped was aurelius
had loued hire best of eny creature
Tuo ȝeer and more as was his aduenture
But neuer durste he telle hire of his greuance
wiþoute cuppe he drank al his penaunce
he was dispeyred no þing durst he seye
Saue in his sawe somwhat wolde he wreye
his woo as in general compleynyng
he sayde he louede and was biloued noþing
Of such matiere made he many layes
Songes compleigntes roundeletis virrelayes
how þat he durste nouȝt his sorwe telle
That langusshiþ as fuyre doþ in helle
And deye seyde he moste as did Ekko
ffor narsisus þat durste nouȝt telle hir wo
In oþer manere þenne ȝe here me seye
Ne durst he nouȝt to hire his wo bewreye
Saue ꝑaduentẽ som tyme at daunces
There ȝong folk kepen here obẜuaunces
hit may wel be he loked on hire face
In such a wise as man þat asked grace
But no þing wiste sche of his entent
Naþeles it happed or þey þennes went
By cause þat he was hire neyȝebõre
And was a man of worschipe and honõ
And hadde knowen him ofte times ȝore
þey felle in speche ofte more and more
vnto his purpos drowe aurelius
And whan he saw his tyme he sayde þus
Ma dame ꝙ he by god þat þis world made
So þat I wiste it mighte ȝour herte glade
I wolde þat day þat ȝour arneragus
wente on þe see þat I aurelius
had went þat I schulde neuer haue come aȝain
ffor wel I woot my seruise is in vayn
My guerdon̄ nys but berstyng of myn herte
Ma dame reweþ vpon my peynes smerte
ffor as wiþ a swerd ȝe may me sle or saue
her at ȝoure foot god wolde þat I were graue
I haue as now no more leysir for to seye
haue mercy on me swete or ȝe wolen do me deye
Sche gan to loke vpon aurelius
Is þis ȝoure wille ꝙ sche and say ȝe þus
Neuer erst ꝙ sche ne wist I what ȝe mente
But now aurely I knowe ȝoure entente
By þilke god þat ȝaf me soule and lyf
Ne schal I neuer be vntrewe wyf
In word ne in werk as fer as I haue wit
I wolen ben his to whom þat I am knyt
But after þat in pleyn þus seyde sche
Tak þis for fynal answer as for me
Aurely qd sche by hihe god aboue
ȝit wol I gũnte ȝou to be ȝoure loue
Seþyns I ȝou se so pitously compleyne
loke what day þat engelond is Bryteyne
ȝe remewe all þe rokkes ston by stoon
þat þay ne lette schip ne boot to goon
I say whan ȝe han made þere costes so clene
Of Rokkes þat þer nys no ston y sene
þan wol I loue ȝou best of any man
haue here my trouþe in al þat euer I can
Is þere non oþer grace qd he
No by þat lord quod sche þat made me
ffor wel I wot þat þat schal neuer betyde
let such folye out of ȝour herte glyde
what deynte schulde man haue by his lijf
ffor to loue anoþ̔ mannes wyf
That haþ hir body whan so þat him likeþ
aurelius fulofte sore sikeþ
wo was aurely whan þat he þis herde
and wiþ a sorwful herte þus answerde
ma dame qd he þis were impossible
Thenne mot I deye on sodeyn deþ orrible
And wiþ þat word he torned him anon
þo came hire oþer frendes many oon
and in þe aleyes romed vp and don̄
and no þing wiste of þis conclusion̄
But sodeinly bygan to reuel newe
Til þat þe brighte sonne loste his hewe
ffor thorisowte haþ raft þe sonne his light
þis is as moche to say as it was night
and home þey gon in Ioye and in solas
Saue oonly wrecched aurelius allas
he to his hous is gon wiþ sorwful herte
he seiþ he may not fro his deþ asterte
him semeþ he feliþ his herte colde
vp to þe heuene his handes gan he holde
And on his knees bare he sette him don̄
And in his rauynge sayde his orison̄
ffor verray wo out of his witte he breyde
he nyste nouȝt what he spak but þus he seyde
wiþ pitous herte haþ he his compleint bygonne
vnto þe goddesse and first vnto þe sonne
he sayde appollo god and gouernour
And euery plaunte herbe tre and flour
þat ȝeuest after þi declinacion̄
To ilk of hem his tyme and his sesoun
And þin herborwe chaungeþ lowe and heiȝe
lord Phebus cast þin merciable eyȝe
On wrecched aurely þat am but lorn
lo lord my lady haþ my deþ y sworn
wiþouten gilt but þin benignite
vpon my dedly herte haue sum pite
But wel I wot lord Phebus if ȝou leste
ȝe may me helpe saue my lady beste
Now vouceþ sauf þat I may ȝou deuyse
how þat I may be holpe and in what wyse
ȝoure blissful suster lucyna þe schene

Though Neptunus haue deyte in þe see
ȝit Empresse abouen him is sche
ȝe knowen wel lord right as hire desire
Is to be quyked and leteþ of ȝoure fire
ffor which sche folweþ ȝou ful besyly
Right to þe see desireþ naturelly
To folwen hire as sche þat is goddesse
Boþe in þe see and in Ryueres more and lesse
Wherfore lord Phebus þis is myn requeste
Do þis myracle or I do myn herte to breste
þat þou next at þis apposicioun
Which in þe signe schal be of þe leoun
And preyed hire so gret a flood to brynge
That .v. fatheme at þe leste it ouer springe
þe hyeste rokke in armorik Britayne
And lete his flood endure ȝeres twayne
Thenne certes to my lady may I saye
holdeþ ȝoure hestes þe rokkes ben awaye
lord Phebꝫ do þis myracle for me
Pray hire sche go no faster cours þan ȝe
I say ȝou þus pray ȝour suster þat sche go
None faster cours þan ȝe þis ȝeres tuo
Then schal sche be euer at þe fulle alway
And springe flood lasten boþe night and day
And but sche fouche sauf in such manere
To gũnte me my lady souerein dere
Preye hire to synken euery rokke a doun
In to hire owne darke region̄
vnder þe grounde þer Pluto duelleþ Inne
Oþer neuer more schal I my lady wynne
Thy temple in Delphos wol I barfoot seeke
lord Phebus seeþ þe teeres on my cheeke
And of my peyne haue compassion̄
And wiþ þat word in swowne he felle a doun
And long tyme he lay in a traunce
his broþer which þat knew of his penaunce
vp caught him and to bedde him broughte
Dispeyred in his torment and in his þought
Lo y þis woful creature lete lye
Chese he for me wheþer he wol lyue or dye
Arneragus wiþ hele and gret honour
As he was of Chyualry þe flour
Is comen home and oþ̔e worþy men
O blisful art þou Dorigen
þat hast þin lusty housbonde in þin armes
þe freissche knight þe worþy man of armes
That loueþ þe as his owen hertes lyf
No þing luste he to be ymaginatyff
Of any wight hadde spoke whils he was oute
To hire of loue he made þer of no doute
he nouȝt entendeþ to no such matere
But daunceþ Iustiþ and makeþ good cheere
As þus in Ioye and blisse I lete hem dwelle
And of þe swete Aurelyus wol I telle
In langure and in furious tormetz þus
Tuo ȝer and more lay wrecche aurelius
Or ony foot on erþe he mighte gon
No confort in þis tyme nade he non
Saue of his broþer which þat was a clerk
he knew of al þis wo and of al þis werk
ffor to non oþer creature certeyn
Of þis matiere ne durste he no word seyn
vnder his brest he bar it more secre
Then euer did Pamphilius for Galathe
his brest was hole wiþouten for to sene
But in his herte was ay þe arwe kene
And wel ȝe knowen þat a sore sauure
In surgerie ful ꝑilous is þe cure
But man might touche þe arwe or come þ̔by
his broþ̔ wepeþ and wayleþ priuyly
Til atte laste him fell in remembũnce
That whiles he was at Orlyaunce in ffũnce
As ȝonge clerkes þat ben likerous
To reden artes þat ben curious
Seken in euery halk and euery herne
Particuler sciences for to lerne
he him remembreþ vpon a day
At Orlyaunce in studye a book he say
Of magiqꝫ naturell which his felawe
That was þat tyme a bachiler of lawe
Al were he þere to lerne anoþ̔ craft
And priuely vpon his deske y laft
This book spak mochli of þis oꝑacion̄s
