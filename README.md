# Project Description

This project aims to train an OCR system on a corpus of medieval manuscripts. Manuscripts pose significant challenges to automated processing, as they feature elaborate and often cryptic handwriting systems (scripts) which vary dramatically across period, region, and scribe. They also tend to contain extensive marginal elements (such as decorations, annotations, or tears) that an engine should be trained to ignore, or treat differently. Finally, given that the most advanced OCR engines often rely on comprehensive dictionaries to improve accuracy, the inconsistent orthography of medieval languages (like Middle English) poses an additional obstacle to efficient automated transcription.

We will be using [Kraken](http://kraken.re/index.html), a turn-key OCR system forked from ocropus. Initially, we will train Kraken on a select set of manuscripts attributed to the same scribe (“Scribe D”), from 15th century England, beginning with *Canterbury Tales* Corpus Christi MS 198, and then moving on to other Scribe D manuscripts. Long-term, we hope to train the system on a much larger corpus of manuscripts, of various scripts and quality.
