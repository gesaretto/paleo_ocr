##Upload Images to Kraken

First make sure images are in .png (you can use a free converter like this one: )

open kraken:
`kraken`

transcribe (automatically uploads image and binarizes it):
`ketos transcribe -o output.html ~/ImagePath`

this creates an output html file in the same folder as your image-- then just click that file
