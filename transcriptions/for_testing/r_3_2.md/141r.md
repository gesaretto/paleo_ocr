Column 1:

fforþ with þe grete lordes alle  
This king seih how it was bifalle  
ffro Tharse and in ꝓsꝑite  
he tok his leue of þat Cite  
and goþ him in to schip ayein  
The wynd was good þe see was plein  
hem nedeþ nought a rif to slake  
Til þey Pentapolim haue take  
The lond which herde of þat tydinge  
was wondir glad of his comynge  
he refteþ him a day or tuo  
And tok his counseil to him þo  
And sette a time of ꝑlemēt  
wher al þe lond of on assent  
fforth with his wijf haþ him coroned  
wher alle good him was foisoned  
lo what it is to be wel grounded  
ffor he haþ first his loue founded  
honestely as for to wedde  
honestely his loue he spedde  
and hadde children with his wijf  
and as him luste he ladde his lijf  
And in ensample his lijf was write  
þat alle louers mighten wite  
how atte laste it schal be sene  
Of loue what þey wolden meene  
ffor se now on þat oþ̔ side  
Antiochus wiþ al his pride  
which sette his loue vnkyndely  
his ende hade sodeinly.  
Sett ayein kinde vppon vengance  
And for his lust haþ his penance  
Lo þus my sone might þou liere  
what is to loue in good maner̉  
and what to loue in oþ̔wise  
The meede arist of þe seruise  
ffortune þough sche be not stable  
yit at som time is fauorable  
To hem þat ben of loue trewe  
But certes it is for to rewe  
To se loue ayein kinde falle  
ffor þat makþ sore aman to falle  
As þou might of tofore rede  
ffor þy my sone I wolde rede  
To lete all oþer loue aweie  
But if it be þurgh such a weie  

Column 2:

As loue and resoun wolde acorde  
ffor elles if þat þou descorde  
And take lust as doþ a beste  
Thy loue may nought ben honeste  
ffor be no skile þat I fynde  
Such lust is nought of loues kynde  
My fader how so þat it stonde  
youre tale is herd and vnderstonde  
as þing which worþi is to hiere  
Of gret ensample and gret matier̉  
wher of my fader god yow quite  
But in þis point my self aquite  
I may right wel þat neu̔e yit  
I was assoted in my witt  
But only in þat worþi place  
wher alle lust and alle g̃ce  
Is sett. if þat daunger ne were  
But þat is al my moste fere  
I not what ye fortune accompte  
But what þing daunger may amonnte  
I wot wel for I haue assaied  
ffor whan mȳ herte is best araied    
And I haue al my witt þorgh sought  
Of loue to beseche hire ought  
ffor al þat eu̔e I sike may  
I am concluded wiþ a nay  
þat oo sillable haþ ouer þrowe  
A þousand wordes on a rowe  
Of suche as I best speke can  
Thus am I but a lewed man  
But fader for ye ben a clerk  
Of loue. and þis matier is derk  
And I can eu̔e leng þe lasse  
But yit I may not lete it passe  
youre hole counseil I beseche  
þat ye me be som weye teche  
what is my beste as for an ende  
My sone vnto þe trouþe wende.  
Now wol I for þe loue of þe  
And lete all oþre trifles be  
The more þat þe nede is hih  
The more it nedeþ to be slih.  
To him which haþ þe nede on honde  
I haue wel herd and vnderstonde  
My sone al þat þou hast me said  
and ek of þat þou hast me praid
