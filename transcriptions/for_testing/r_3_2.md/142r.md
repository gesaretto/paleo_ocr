Column 1:

Nought of an oxe what him eyleþ  
It falleþ ofte a man merueileþ  
Of þat he seþ anoþer fare  
But if he knewe himself þe fare  
and felte it as it is in soth  
he scholde do right as he doþ   
Or elles worse in his degre  
ffor wel I wot and so do ye  
That loue haþ eue̔ yit ben vsed  
So moot I nedes ben excused  
But fader if ye wolde þus  
vnto Cupide and to venus  
Be frendlich vnto my querele   
So þat mȳ herte were in hele   
Of loue which is in my brest  
I wot wel þanne a bettre p̔st    
was neu̔e mad to my behoue  
But al þe while þat I houe  
In non̄certein bituen þe tuo  
And not wher I to wel or wo  
Schal torne. þat is al my drede    
So þat I not what is to red  
But for final conclusion̄  
I þenke a supplicacioun  
wiþ pleyne wordes ⁊ exp̔sse  
write vnto Ven9 þe goddesse  
þe which I prie yow to bere  
And bringe ayein a good answere  
Tho was betwen my prest and me  
Debat. and gret ꝑplexite  
My resoun vndirstod him wel  
and knew it was soþ eu̔y del  
That he haþ seid but nought for þy   
My will haþ no þing sett þ̔by  
ffor touching of so wis a port  
Is vnto loue of no desport  
yit mighte neu̔e man beholde  
Reson̄ wher loue was wiþholde  
þey ben nought of o gou̔nance  
and þus we fellen in destance  
My prest and I but I spak fair̉  
and þorgh my wordes debonaire  
Thanne atte laste þey acorden  
So þat he seith he wol recorden  
To speke and stonde vppō my side  
To Venus boþe and to Cupide  

Column 2:

And bad me write what I wolde  
And seiþ me trewely þat he scholde  
My lettre bere vnto þe queene  
And I sat doun Vppon þe grene  
ffulfild of loues fantasie   
And with þe teeres of mȳ yhe  
In stede of enke I gan to write  
The wordes whiche I wole endite  
vnto Cupide and to Venus  
And in my lettre I seide thus  
The woful peyne of loues maladie  
Ayein þe which may no phisiqꝫ auaile  
Min herte haþ so bewhaped wiþ sotie  
þat wher so þat I reste or trauaile  
I fynde it eu̔e redy to assaile  
My reson̄ which þat can him nought defende  
Thus seche I helpe wher of I mighte amende  
First to nature if þat I me compleyne  
Ther fynde I how þat eu̔y creature  
Som tyme a yeer haþ loue in his demeyne  
So þat þe litel wrenne in his mesur̉  
haþ yit of kinde of loue vnder his cure  
And I but o desir of which I misse  
And þus but I haþ eu̔y kinde his blisse  
The reson̄ of my witt it ouerpasseþ  
Of þat nature techeþ me þe weie.  
To loue. and yit no certein sche cōpasseþ  
how I schal spede and þus betuen þe tweie  
I stonde. and not if I schal lyue or deie  
ffor þough treson̄ ayein my wil debate  
I may nought fle þat I ne loue algate  
Uppon my self is þilke tale come  
how whilom which is þe god of kynde  
wiþ loue wrastled. and is ou̔come  
ffor euer I wrastle and eu̔e I am behinde  
þat I no strengþe in al mȳ herte I fynde  
wher of þat I may stonden eny þrowe  
So ferr my witt with loue is ou̔þrowe  
Whom nedeþ helpe he mot his helpe cũe  
Or helpeles he schal his neede spille  
Pleinly þorghout my wittes all I haue  
But non of hem can helpe aftir my wille  
And als so wel I mighte sitte stille  
As preie vnto my lady eny helpe  
Thus woot I nought wherof my self to yelpe  
vnto þe grete Ioue and if I bidde
