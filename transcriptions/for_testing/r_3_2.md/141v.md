Column 1:

Now at þis time þat I schal  
As for conclusion final  
Counseil vppon þy nede sette  
So þenke I finally to knette  
Thy cause wher it is tobroke  
and make an ende of þat is spoke  
ffor I behighte þe þat þifte  
fferst whan þou com vndir my schrifte  
þat þough I toward Venus were  
yit spak I suche wordes þere  
þat for þe p̔stode which I haue  
myn ordre and myn astat to saue  
I seid I wolde of myn office  
To v̉tu more þan to vice  
Encline. and teche þe my lore  
ffor þy to speken ou̔more  
Of loue which þe may auaile  
Tak loue wher it may auaile  
ffor as of þis which þou art Inne  
Be þat þou seist it is a synne  
and synne may no pris deserue  
wiþoute pris and who schal serue  
I not what ꝓfit might auaile  
Thus folweþ it if þou trauaile   
wher þou no ꝓfit hast ne pris  
Thou art toward þiself vnwis  
and siþþe þou mightest lust atteyne  
Of eu̔y lust þe ende is peyne  
And eu̔y peyne is good to flee  
So is it wonder þing to see  
why such a þing schal be desired  
þe more þat a stok is fired  
þe raþere in to aisshe it torneþ  
The foot which in þe were sporneþ  
ffulofte his hed haþ ou̔throwe  
þis loue is blind and can nought knowe   
wher þat he goþ til he be falle  
ffor þi but if it so bifalle  
wiþ good counseil þat he be lad  
him oughte for to ben adrad  
ffor counseil passeþ all þing  
To him which þenkþ to ben a king  
and eu̔y man for his partie  
A kingdom haþ to iustifie  
þat is to seie his oughne doom  
If he misrewele þat kingdoom  

Column 2:

he leeseþ himself and þat is more  
Than if he loste schipp and oore  
And al þe worldes good wiþ al  
ffor what mā þat in special  
he nought himself he haþ nought elles  
Nomore þe perles þan þe schelles  
Al is to him of oo Value  
þough he hadde at his retenue  
The wide world right as he wolde   
whan he his herte haþ nought wiþholde    
Toward himself. al is in vein  
and þus my sone I wolde sein  
As I seide er þat þou arise  
Er þat þou falle in such a wise  
þat þou ne might þiself recouer̉  
ffor loue which þat blind was euer̉  
Makþ all his ẜuantz blinde also  
My sone and if þou haue ben so  
yit is it tyme to wiþdrawe  
and sett þin herte vnder þat lawe.  
The which of reson̄ is gouerned.  
and nought of will and to be lerned    
Ensamples þou hast many on  
Of now and ek of tyme agon  
That eu̔y lust is but a while  
and who þat wole himself beguyle  
he may þe raþer be deceyued  
My sone now þou hast conceyued  
Som what of þat I wolde meene  
hier aftirward it schal be seene  
If þat þou lerne vpon my lore  
ffor I can do to þe nomore  
But teche þe þe righte weie  
and ches if þou wilt liue or deie  
My fader so as I haue herd  
youre tale but it were answerd  
I were mochil for to blame  
My wo to yow is but a game  
þat feelen nought of þat I feele  
The feeling of a mannes heele  
May nought be likned to þe herte  
I may nought þough I wolde asterte  
And ye be fre from al þe peyne  
Of loue. wher of I me pleyne  
It is right esy to comānde.  
þe hert. which free goþ on þe launde
