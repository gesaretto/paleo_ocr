he schal no gospel preche her̉ ne teche  
we leuyn all in þe grete god qd he  
he wolde schewen som difficulte  
Or springen cokkil in our clene corn  
And þerfor oft I warne þe byforn  
My ioly body schal a tale telle  
¶here endith þe man of lawe his tale.  
¶Here bygynneth the prologe of the Wyf of Bathe  
Exꝑiens þough noon auctorite  
were in þis world. it were ynough for me  
To speke of wo þat is in mariage  
ffor lordyngs syns twelf ȝer was of age  
I thank it god þat is eterne on lyue  
housbondes atte chirch dore. I haue had fyue  
ffor I so ofte might haue weddid be  
And all were worþy men in here degre  
But me was taught nought longe tyme goon is  
That synnes crist went neuer but onys  
To weddyng in þe Cane of Galile  
That by þe same ensampul taught he me  
That I ne weddid schulde be but ones  
herken such a scharp word for þe nones  
Biside a welle Ihc god and man.  
Spak in reproef of þe Samaritan  
Thow hast y had fyue housbondes quod he  
And þat ilk man which þat now haþ þe  
Is nouȝt þin housbond þus he sayd certayn  
what he ment þer by I can not sayn  
But þat I axe why þe fyfte man  
was nought housbond to þe Samaritan  
how many might sche haue in mariage  
ȝit herd I neuer tellen in myn age  
vppon þis noumbre diffinicioun  
Men may diuine and glosen vp and doun  
But wel I wot wiþouten eny lye  
God bad vs for to. wax and multiplie  
That gentil tixt can I wel vnderstonde  
Ek wel I wot he sayd myn housebonde
