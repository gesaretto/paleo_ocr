WEl sayd by corpus boones quod oure host  
Now longe mot þou sayle by þe cost  
Sir gentil maister gentil mariner  
God ȝiue þe monk a þousand last quadeȝer  
haha felaws be war for such a iape  
The monk put in þe mannes hood an ape  
And in his wyues eek by seint austyn  
Draweþ no monkes more vnto ȝour In  
But now pasouer and let vs loke aboute  
Who schal telle first of al þis route  
Anoþer tale and wiþ þat with þat word he sayde  
As curteisly as it had ben a mayde  
My lady prioresse by ȝour leue  
So þat I wist I scholde ȝow not greue

A tale next if so were þat ȝe wolde  
Now wol ȝe vouche sauf my lady deere  
Gladly quod sche and sayd in þis manere  

O lord oure lord þy name how merueylous ...
