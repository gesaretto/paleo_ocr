WEl sayd by corpus boones quod oure host  
Now longe mot þou sayle by þe cost

The monk put in þe mannes hood an ape  
And in his wyues eek by seint austyn

Who schal telle first of al þis route  
Anoþer tale and wiþ þat with þat word he sayde  
As curteisly as it had ben a mayde

Which þat þe bar and is a mayde alway  
To telle a story I wil do my labour  
Nought þat I may encresce ȝoure honour

Of bounte next hir sone and soules boote  
O modir mayde. O mayde mooder fre  
O bussh vnbrent brennyng in Moises sight  
That rauysshedest doun fro þe deite  
Thurgh þin humblesse þe gost þat in þe alight  
Of whos vertu he in þin herte pight
