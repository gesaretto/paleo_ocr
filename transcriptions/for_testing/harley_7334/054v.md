Til þat her corn was fair and wel I grounde  
And whan þe mele was sakked and I bounde  
This Iohn goþ out and fynt his hors a way  
And gan to crye harrow and weylaway  
Oure hors is lost aleyn for goddes banes  
Step on þy feet cum on man al at anes  
Aleyn ȝour wardeyn haþ his parfray lorn  
This aleyn al forgeteþ mele and corn  
Al was out of his mynd his housbondrye  
What wikked way is he gan gan he crye  
The wyf cam lepyng inward wiþ a ren  
Sche seyde allas ȝour hors goþ to þe fen  
wiþ wylde mares as fast as he may go  
...
