Til þat her corn was fair and wel I grounde  
And whan þe mele was sakked and I bounde  
This Iohn goþ out and fynt his hors a way  
And gan to crye harrow and weylaway  
Oure hors is lost aleyn for goddes banes  
Step on þy feet cum on man al at anes  
Aleyn ȝour wardeyn haþ his parfray lorn  
This aleyn al forgeteþ mele and corn  
Al was out of his mynd his housbondrye  
What wikked way is he gan gan he crye  
The wyf cam lepyng inward wiþ a ren  
Sche seyde allas ȝour hors goþ to þe fen  
wiþ wylde mares as fast as he may go  
vnþank come on his heed þat band him so  
And he þat bettir schuld han knyt þe Reyne  
Allas qd Iohn̈ aleyn|for cristes peyne  
leg doun þi swerd and I sal myn alswa  
I is ful wight god wat as is a Ra  
By goddes hart he sal nat scape vs bathe  
why nad þou put þe capil in þe lathe  
Ilhail aleyn by god þou is a fon  
This sely clerkes speeden hem anoon  
Toward þe fen boþe aleyn and eek Ion  
And whan þe myller sawh þat þey were gon  
he half a busshel of þe flour haþ take  
And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake

ȝet can a Miller make a clerkes berd  
ffor al his art ȝe lat hem go here way  
lo wher þey goon ȝe lat þe children play  
They get him nat lightly by my cron̄
This seely clerkes ronnen vp and don̄

Ga wightly þou and I sal keep him heere  
But schortly til þat it was verray night  
They cowde nat þough þey did al here might  
here capil cacche it ran away so fast  
Til in a diche þey caught him atte last
