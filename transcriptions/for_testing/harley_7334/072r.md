But certeynly no worde writeþ he  
Of þilke wikked ensample of Canace  
That loued hir owen broþer synfully  
On whiche corsed stories I seye fy  
Or elles of Tyro appoloneus  
how þat þe cursed kyng anteochus  
Byreft his doughter of hir maydenhede  
That is so horrible a tale as man may reede  
whan he hir þrew vpon þe pament  
And þerfore he of ful auysement  
wolde neuer wryte in non of his sermon̄s  
Of such vnkynde abhominacion̄s  
Ne I wol non reherse if þat I may  
But of my tale how schal I do þis day  
Me were loth to be lykned douteles  
To muses þat men clepen Pyerides  
Methamorphoseos wot what I mene  
But naþeles I recche nat a bene  
They I come after him with hawe bake  
I speke in prose and let him rymes make  
And wiþ þat word he wiþ a sobre cheere  
Bygan his tale as ȝe schal aft̔ heere ¶Expliciᵗ ꝓlogꝯ incipit fabula  
hateful harm condicion̄ of pouert  
wiþ þurst wiþ cold wiþ honger so confoundyd  
To asken help it schameþ in þin hert  
If þou non aske wiþ neede so art þou woundyd  
That verray neede vnwrappeþ al þy woūdes hyd  
Maugre þyn heed þou most for Indigence  
Or stele or begge or borwe þy dispence  
Thow blamest crist and seyst ful bitterly  
he mys departeþ riches temporal  
And þyn neyhebour þou wytes synfully  
And seyst þou hast to litel and he haþ al  
Ꝑfay seystow som tyme he rekne schal  
whan þat his tayl schal brennen in þe gleede  
ffor he nought helpeth þe needful in his neede  
HErkneþ what is þe sentens of þe wyse  
Bet is to dye þan haue indigence
