For deth þat takþ of heigh ⁊ low his rent  
whan passed was a ȝeere as I gesse  
Out of þis worlde kyng alla he hent  
ffor whom Custauns haþ ful gret heuynesse  
Now let vs pray. þat god his soule blesse  
And dame Custaunce fynally to say  
Toward þe toun of Rome goþ hir way  
To Rome is come þis nobil creature  
And fynt hir freendes þer boþe hool ⁊ sound  
Now is sche skaped al hir auenture  
And whanne sche hir fader had I founde  
Doun on hir knees falleþ sche to grounde  
wepyng for tendirnes in herte blithe  
Sche heried god an hundred þousand sithe  
In vertu and in holy almesdede  
They lyuen all.and neu̔ a sondre wende  
Til deþ departe hem þis lyf þey lede  
And far now wel my tale is at an ende  
Now ihū crist þat of his might may sende  
Ioy after wo gouerne vs in his grace  
And keep ous alle þat ben in þis place  
Our Ost vppon his styrops stood anoon  
And seyde good m
ē herkneth euỷ
