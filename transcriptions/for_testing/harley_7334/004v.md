his eyȝen twynkeled in his heed aright  
As don þe sterres in þe frosty night  
This worthi lymytour was called huberd  
Marchaunt was þer wiþ a forked berd  
In motteleye high on horse he sat  
vppon his heed a fflaūdrisch beuer hat  
his botus clapsud faire and fetously  
his resons he spak ful solempnely  
Swownynge alway the encres of his wynnyng  
he wolde þe see were kepud for eny þing  
Bitwixe Middulburgh and Orewelle  
wel couþe he in eschange scheeldes selle  
This worþi man ful wel his witte bisette  
Ther wiste no man that he was in dette  
So estately was he of gouernaūce  
With his bargayns and with his cheuysaūce  
ffor sothe he was a worþi man with alle  
But soth to say I not what men him calle  
Clerk þer was of Oxenford also  
That vnto logik hadde longe I go  
Also lene was his hors as is a rake  
And he was not right fat I vndertake  
But lokede holwe and þ̔to soburly  
fful thredbare was his ouerest courtepy  
ffor he hadde nouȝt geten him ȝit a benefice  
Ne was not worþy to hauen an office  
ffor him was leuer haue at his beddes heed  
Twenty bookes cloþed in blak and reed  
Of aristotil and of his philosophie  
Thẻ Robus Riche or fithul or Sawtrie  
But al þough he were a philosophie  
ȝet hadde he but litul gold in cofre  
But al þat he might gete and his frendes sende  
On bookes and his lernyng he it spende  
And busily gan for þe soules pray  
Of hem þat ȝaf him wherwith to scolay  
Of studie tooke he most cure and heede  
Not oo word spak he more þan was neede
