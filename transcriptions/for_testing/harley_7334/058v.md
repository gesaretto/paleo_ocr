wel were þe wenche þat mighte him meete  
FOr whan þer eny rydyng was in cheepe  
Out of þe schoppe þider wolde he lepe  
Tyl he hadde al þat sight I seyn  
And daunced wel he nold nat come ageyn  
And gadred him a meyne of his sort  
To hoppe and synge and make such disport  
And þer þey setten steuene for to meete  
To pleyen atte dys in such a strete  
ffor in þe toun ne was þer no prentys  
That fairer cowde caste a peyre dys  
Than Ꝑkyn couþe and þ̔to he was free  
Of his dispence in place of pryuyte  
That fand his mayster wel in his chaffare  
ffor often tyme he fond his box ful bare  
ffor such a ioly prentys reuelour  
That haunteþ dys Reuel or ꝑamour  
his maister schal it in his schoppe abye  
Al haue he no part of þe mynstralcye  
ffor þefte and ryot be conuertyble  
Al can þey pley on giterne and rubible  
Reuel and trouþe as in a lowe degre  
They ben ful wroþ al day as ȝe may see  
This Ioly Prentys with his mayster bood  
Til he was oute neyȝ of his prentys hood  
Al were he snybbyd boþe erly and late  
And somtyme lad with reuel in to Newgate  
But atte laste his mayster him byþought  
vpon a day whan he his papyr sought  
Of a prouerbe þat siþ þis same word  
wel bette is roten appul out of hord  
Than it rote al þe remenaunt  
So fareþ it by a ryotous ẜuaunt  
hit is ful lasse harm to late him pace  
Than he schend al þe seruauntes in þe place  
Therfore his mayster ȝaf him acqueyntaūce  
And bad hī go wiþ sorwe and wiþ meschaūce  
And þus þe ioly p̉ntys had his leue Now let hȳ ryot al þe night or leue
