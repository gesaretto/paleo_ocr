ȝe schul pay fourty pound so god me saue  
And nere þe frendschipe ȝat ȝe dede er þis  
To me ȝe schulde paye more I wys  
This prest ȝe somme of fourty pound anoon  
Of nobles fette and took hem euerychoon  
To þis chanon̄ for þis ilk receyt  
Al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceyt  
Sire prest he seyde I kepe haue no loos  
Of my craft for I would it kept were cloos  
And as ȝe loueþ me kepeþ it secre  
ffor and men knewe al my sotilte  
By god men wolden haue so gret enuye  
To me by cause of my philosophie  
I schulde be deed þer were noon oþer weye  
God it forbede quoþ þe prest what seye  
ȝet had I leuer spenden al þe good  
which þat I haue and elles wax I wood  
Than þat ȝe schulde falle in such meschief  
ffour ȝour good wil sir haue ȝe right good preef  
Quoþ þe chanoun and far wel günt mercy  
he went his way and neuer þe prest him sey  
After þis day and whan þat þis prest scholde  
Maken assay at such tyme as he wolde  
Of þis receyt far wel it wold not be  
lo þus byiaped and bygilt was he  
Thus makeþ he his introduction̄  
To bringe folk to here destruction̄  
Considereth sires how þat in ech astaat
Bitwixe men and gold þer is debaat  
So ferforth þat vnneþe þer is noon  
This myultiplying blent so many oon  
That in good faith I trowe þat it be  
The cause grettest of which skarsete  
Philosophres speken so mistyly  
In þis craft þat men conne not come þer by  
ffor any witt þat men han now on dayes  
They may wel chiteren as doon þese iayes  
And in here termes sette lust and peyne
