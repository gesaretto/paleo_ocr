Approche ner and loke merily  
Now ware ȝou sires and let þis man haue space  
he in þe wast is schape as wel as I  
This were a popet in an arm to embrace  
ffor any wom̄an smal and fair of face  
he semeþ eluish by his countenaunce  
ffor vnto no wight doth he daliaunce  
Say now som what sins other folk han said  
Telle vs a tale and that of mirthe anoon  
host quod I ne beþ nought euel apayd  
ffor other tale certes can I noon  
But of a rym I lerned ȝore agoon  
ȝe þat is good quod he now schul we heere  
Som deynte þing me þinketh by his cheere  

Esteneþ lordyngs. in good entent  
And I wol telle verrayment  
Of myrthe and solas  
Of a knyght was fair and gent  
In batail and in tornament  
his name was sir Thopas  
I bore he was in fer countre  
In fflaundres al byȝonde þe se  
At poperyng in þe place  
his fader was a man ful fre  
And lord he was of þat contre  
As it was goddes grace  
Sir Thopas wax a doughty swayn  
Whyt was his face as payndemayn  
his lippes reed as Rose  
his rode is lik scarlet en grayn  
As I ȝow telle in good certayn  
he had a semply nose  
his heer his berd was lik safroun  
That to is girdil raughta doun  
his schoon of Cordewane
Of Brigges were his hosen broun  
his robe was of Sicladoun
