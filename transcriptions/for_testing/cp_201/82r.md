Ergo þere is no name / to þe name of Ihs̄.   
Ne non name so needful / to nempne / by nyghtis ne be dayes.
For alle þe derke deuelis / are a-dred to heeren y-nempned.
& synful soulis ben solaced / & savid be þat name.
¶ Why calle ȝee hym þanne crist / what cause ȝee me telle.
¶ For crist is moore of myght / & of more worthiere name.
Þan Iesu er Iesus / þat al oure Ioyȝe of spryngeþ.
¶ Knowest þou weel quod conscience / & þou kone good resoun.
Þat a knyght . & a kyng . & conquerour / may ben al on persone.
¶ To ben clepd a knyght is fayr / for men shulle knele til hym.
¶ To ben callid a kyng is fairere / for a kyng mai knyghtis make.
¶ For to ben conquerour calid / þat comeþ of goddis special grace.
& of hardynesse of herte / & also of hendenesse.
To maken lordis & ladijs / in londys þat þey wynne.
& free men / fowle þralle / þat folwe not hise lawes.
¶ For þe Iewis þat weren Ientyl-men / Iesu þey dyspisede.
Boþe his loore / & his lawe / & now be þey lowe cherlis.
As wyȝd as þis world ys / whonen þere noone.
But vndir tribut / & tallyage / as tykes & cherlys.
& þo þat by-come cristene / by conseyl of bapteme.
Arn Frankeleynes & free men / þorghȝ fullyng þat þei take.
& Ientil-men with Iesu / for Iesu was y-fullid.
Vpon Caluerye / on þe cros / & korouned kyng of Iewis.
It be-comeþ wel to a kyng / to kepen his lond & to defende it.
& conquerour of his conquest /. hyse lordis to ȝeve hem large.
¶ & so dyde Iesus to þe Iewis / he Iusted & tawhte hem.
Þe lawe of lyf / þat lasten shal euere more.
& fendid fram hem fowle evelis / boþe fyueres . & eek fluxis.
& feendis þat in hem was / & eek fals by-leve.
Þo was he Iesu of Iewis callyd / & þe Ientil prophete.
& kyng of kyngdomm & crowne he bar of þornes.
& þo conquerid he on þe cros / a conquerour noble.
Myghte no deeþ hym for-do / ne noþyng doun brynge.
Þat he a-roos & regnede / & ravischede helle.
& þo was he conquerour cald / of qwike & of dede.
For he ȝaf Adam & Eve / & oþere moo blysse.
Þat longe hadde leyn by-fore / as lucyferis chirlys.
