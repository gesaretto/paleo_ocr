Ergo þ̉e is no name / to þe name of Ihs̄.   
Ne nō name so needful / to nēpne / by nyghtis ne be dayes.  
ffor aỻ þe derke deuelis / are a dred to heeren y nēpned.  
⁊ synful souꝉ ben solaced / ⁊ saVid be þͭ name.  
¶why calle ȝee hȳ þanne c͛st / what cause ȝee me teỻ.  
¶ffor c͛st is moor̉ of myght / ⁊ of mor̉ worthier̉ name.

¶knowest þͧ weel qd conscience / ⁊ þͧ kone good resoū.  
þͭ a knyght . ⁊ a kyng. ⁊ cōquerour / may ben al on ꝑsone.  
¶To ben clepd a knyght is fayr / for mē shuỻ knele til hȳ.  
¶To ben callid a kyng is fair̉re / for a kyng mai knyghtis make.  
¶ffor to ben cōquerour calid / þͭ comeþ of godɖ special g̈ce.    
⁊ of hardynesse of herte / ⁊ also of hendenesse.  
To maken lordis ⁊ ladijs / in londys þͭ þey wynne.  
⁊ free mē / fowle þraỻ / þͭ folwe not hise lawes.  
¶ffor þe Iewis þͭ weren Ientyl mē / Isū þey dyspiseɖ.  
Boþe his loor̉ / ⁊ his lawe / ⁊ now be þey lowe cherlis.  
As wyȝd as þis world ys / whonen þer̉ noone.  
But Vndir t͛but / ⁊ tallyage / as tykes ⁊ cherlys.  
⁊ þo þat by-come cristene / by conseyl of bapteme.  
Arn ffrankeleynes ⁊ free mē / þorghȝ fuỻyng þͭ þei take.  
⁊ Ientil mē wͭ Ihū / for Ihū was y fullid.  
Vpon Caluerye / on þe cros / ⁊ korouned kyng of Iewis.  
It be comeþ wel to a kyng / to kepen his lond ⁊ to defende it.  
⁊ cōquerour of his cōquest /. hyse lordis to ȝeve hē large.  
¶⁊ so dyde Ihū to þe Iewis / he Iusted ⁊ tawhte hem.  
þe lawe of lyf / þat lasten shal eủe mor̉.  
⁊ fendid fram hē fowle eVelis / boþe fyủes. ⁊ eek fluxis.  
⁊ feendis þͭ in hem was / ⁊ eek fals by leVe.  
þo was he Ihū of Iewis callyd / ⁊ þe Ientil ꝓpħe.  
⁊ kyng of kyngdōm ⁊ crowne he bar of þornes.  
⁊ þo cōquerid he on þe cros / a cōquerour noble.  
Myghte no deeþ hȳ for do / ne noþȳg doū brȳnge.

⁊ þo was he cōquerour cald / of qwike ⁊ of dede.  
ffor he ȝaf Adam ⁊ EVe / ⁊ oþere moo blysse.  
þͭ longe hadde leyn by for̉ / as lucyferis chirlys.
