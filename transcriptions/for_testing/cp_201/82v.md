¶⁊ þāne took he lotthly lucifer / þͭ loord was of heỻ.    
⁊ bond his as his bondemā / wͭ bondis of yrene.

To maken aỻ folk free / þͭ folwen hise lawes.  
¶⁊ sytthen he ȝeVeþ largely / aỻ hise leele lygis.  
places in ꝑadis / at here deꝑtynge hennes.

¶But þe cause þͭ he comeþ þus / wͭ his cros of his passioū.  
Is to wissen Vs þ̔e wͭ / whan we been y tēptyd.  
þer wͭ / to fyghte ⁊ defende Vs / fro fallȳg in to synne.  
⁊ to seen be his sorwe / þͭ who-so loveþ Ioyȝe.  
To penaunce ⁊ to pouerte / he muste pyttyn hym-selue.  
⁊ mychel woo / in þis world / wylnen ⁊ suffren.  
¶But to carpe more of crist / ⁊ how he cam to þͭ name.  
Faythly / for to speke / his fyrste name was Iesus.  
Þoo he was boore in bedleem / as . bookys boldly tellyn.  
⁊ cam to take mankynde / boþe kyngys ⁊ angelis.  
Reuerensed hym ryght fayre / wͭ rycchesse of erthe.  
Angelis out of heuene / come knelynge ⁊ sungen.  
Gloria in excelcis deo.  
¶Kyngis kemen after / ⁊ kneled to hym ⁊ offreden.  
Ensens / ⁊ myrre . ⁊ myche gold / wͭ myche mercy asked.  
Er of ony kenne Catele / þey knowlechid hym . here souereyn.  
Boþe of sunne . of sond . ⁊ see / ⁊ sythis hoom þey wentyn.  
In-to here kyngene kyþ / be kennynge of an angel.  
⁊ þerwith was þe woord / ful-fyld / þe wiche first þou speke  
Omnia celestia / terrestria flectantur in hoc nomine Iesu.  
¶For aỻ þe angelis of hevene / at his berthe þey kneliden.  
⁊ al þe witt in þis world / was þoo in þre þynges.  
Resoun . ⁊ Ryghtwisnesse / ⁊ rewþe / þey offreden.  
¶Where-fore / ⁊ why  wyse men þͭ tyme.  
Boþe Maistris ⁊ men y-leernede / Magy hem nameden.  
¶Þe ton kyng cam wͭ resoun / y-kouered vndir ensense.  
Þe toþir kyng sytthe / sooþly he offrede.  
Ryghtwyȝsnesse vndir reed gold / þͭ lasten shal euere.  
For it shal turne tresoun / to ryght ⁊ to trewthe.  
Þe þrydde kyng þo cam / ⁊ knelid to Iesu lowe.
