wolde han made ony pensyf herte light  
That euer was born but if to gret siknesse  
Oþer to gret sorwe hyld it in distresse  
And after dynere gan þey to daunce  
So ful it was of beaute with plesaunce  
And synge also but dorigen allone  
Sche made alwey hire compleynt and hire mone  
ffoor sche ne saugh him on þe daunce go  
þat was hire housbond and hir loue also  
But naþeles sche moste a tyme abyde  
And with good hope sche let hir sorwe glyde  
vpon þis daunce amonges oþer men  
Daunced a squier biforen Dorigen  
That freisscher was and iolyer of array  
As to my dome þan is þe monþe of May  
he syngeþ and daunceþ passyng any man  
That is or was siþenes þis world bygan  
There wiþ he was if men schulde him discryue  
On þe beste farynge man on lyue  
ȝong strong right vertuous riche and wys  
And wel biloued and holden in gret prys  
And schortliche if þe soþe telle I schal  
vnwytyng of þis Dorigen at al  
This lusty squyer ẜuaunt to venus  
which þat y cleped was aurelius  
had loued hire best of eny creature  
Tuo ȝeer and more as was his aduenture  
But neuer durste he telle hire of his greuance  
wiþoute cuppe he drank al his penaunce  
he was dispeyred no þing durst he seye  
Saue in his sawe somwhat wolde he wreye  
his woo as in general compleynyng  
he sayde he louede and was biloued noþing  
Of such matiere made he many layes  
Songes compleigntes roundeletis virrelayes  
how þat he durste nouȝt his sorwe telle
