A ȝeer and more lasted þis blisful lijf  
Til þat þis knight of which I spak of þus  
þat of kynrede was cleped arneragus  
Schope him to gon and dwelle a ȝeer or tweyne  
In engelond þat cleped eek was bretayne  
To seche in armes worschipe and eek honõ  
ffor all his lust he sette in such labour  
And dwelleþ þere þe book saiþ þus  
Now wol I stynte of þis arneragus  
And speken I wole of dorygen his wijf  
þat loueþ hir housbonde as hire hertes lyf  
And for his absens wepeþ sche and sikeþ  
As don þese noble wyues when hem likeþ  
Sche mourneþ wakeþ wayleþ fasteþ ⁊ pleyneþ  
Desire of his p̉sence hire so destreyneþ  
That all þis wyde world sche sette at nouȝt  
hire freendes which þat knewe hire heuy þouȝt  
Conforted hire in al þat euer þey mighte or may
They prechen hire þay tellen hire night and day  
þat causeles sche sleeþ hire self allas  
And eủy confort possible in þis cas  
þey don to hire wiþ all here busynes  
And all to make hire lete hir heuynes  
By ꝓcesse as ȝe knowe wel eủychon  
Men may so longe grauen in þe ston  
Til som figure þ̉inne enprentyd be  
Solonge han þey conforted hire þat sche  
Receyued haþ by hope and by reson̄  
The empryntyng of hir constillacion̄  
Thurgh which hire grete sorwe gan aswage  
Sche may nought alway endure in such a rage  
And eek arneragus in al þis care  
haþ sent his ꝉres home in al þis fare  
And þat he wolde come hastly aȝayn  
Oþer hadde þis sorwe hire herte slayn  
hire frendes sawe hire herte gan to slake
