No þing luste he to be ymaginatyff  
Of any wight hadde spoke whils he was oute  
To hire of loue he made þer of no doute  
he nouȝt entendeþ to no such matere  
But daunceþ Iustiþ and makeþ good cheere  
As þus in Ioye and blisse I lete hem dwelle  
And of þe swete Aurelyus wol I telle  
In langure and in furious tormetz þus  
Tuo ȝer and more lay wrecche aurelius  
Or ony foot on erþe he mighte gon  
No confort in þis tyme nade he non  
Saue of his broþer which þat was a clerk  
he knew of al þis wo and of al þis werk  
ffor to non oþer creature certeyn  
Of þis matiere ne durste he no word seyn  
vnder his brest he bar it more secre  
Then euer did Pamphilius for Galathe  
his brest was hole wiþouten for to sene  
But in his herte was ay þe arwe kene  
And wel ȝe knowen þat a sore sauure  
In surgerie ful ꝑilous is þe cure  
But man might touche þe arwe or come þ̉by  
his broþ̉ wepeþ and wayleþ priuyly  
Til atte laste him fell in remembünce  
That whiles he was at Orlyaunce in ffünce  
As ȝonge clerkes þat ben likerous  
To reden artes þat ben curious  
Seken in euery halk and euery herne  
Particuler sciences for to lerne  
he him remembreþ vpon a day  
At Orlyaunce in studye a book he say  
Of magiqꝫ naturell which his felawe  
That was þat tyme a bachiler of lawe  
Al were he þere to lerne anoþ̉ craft  
And priuely vpon his deske y laft  
This book spak mochli of þis oꝑacion̄s
