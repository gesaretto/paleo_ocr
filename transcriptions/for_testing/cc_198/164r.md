Which in þe signe schal be of þe leoun  
And preyed hire so gret a flood to brynge  
That .v. fatheme at þe leste it ouer springe  
þe hyeste rokke in armorik Britayne  
And lete his flood endure ȝeres twayne  
Thenne certes to my lady may I saye  
holdeþ ȝoure hestes þe rokkes ben awaye  
lord Phebꝫ do þis myracle for me  
Pray hire sche go no faster cours þan ȝe  
I say ȝou þus pray ȝour suster þat sche go  
None faster cours þan ȝe þis ȝeres tuo  
Then schal sche be euer at þe fulle alway  
And springe flood lasten boþe night and day  
And but sche fouche sauf in such manere  
To gũnte me my lady souerein dere  
Preye hire to synken euery rokke a doun  
In to hire owne darke region̄  
vnder þe grounde þer Pluto duelleþ Inne  
Oþer neuer more schal I my lady wynne  
Thy temple in Delphos wol I barfoot seeke  
lord Phebus seeþ þe teeres on my cheeke  
And of my peyne haue compassion̄  
And wiþ þat word in swowne he felle a doun  
And long tyme he lay in a traunce  
his broþer which þat knew of his penaunce  
vp caught him and to bedde him broughte  
Dispeyred in his torment and in his þought  
Lo y þis woful creature lete lye  
Chese he for me wheþer he wol lyue or dye  
Arneragus wiþ hele and gret honour  
As he was of Chyualry þe flour  
Is comen home and oþ̔e worþy men  
O blisful art þou Dorigen  
þat hast þin lusty housbonde in þin armes  
þe freissche knight þe worþy man of armes  
That loueþ þe as his owen hertes lyf
