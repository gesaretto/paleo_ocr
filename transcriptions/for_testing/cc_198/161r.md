And preyed hire on knees for goddes sake  
To come and rome hire in companye  
Away to dryue hire derke fantasye  
And fynally sche günted þat requeste  
ffor wel sche sawe it was for þe beste  
Now stood hire castel faste by þe see  
And often wiþ hire freendes walked sche  
hire to disporte on þe banke on heih  
wher as sche many schippe and barge seih  
Seylinge here cours where hem luste to go  
But ȝit was þere a parcelle of hir wo  
ffor to hir self fuloften seyde sche  
Is þer no schipp of so many as I se  
wole brynge home my lord þen wolde myn herte  
Al waryssche of þis bitter peynes smerte  
Anoþer tyme þer wole sche sitte and þinke  
And caste hire eyen dounward fro þe brynke  
But whan sche saugh þe grisly rokkes blake  
ffor verray fere so wolde hire herte quake  
þat on hire feet sche mighte nought hire sustene  
Thenne wolde sche sitte a doun vpon þe grene  
And pitously in to þe see byholde  
And sayn right þus wiþ sorowful hertes colde  
Eterne god þat þurgh þy puruyaunce  
ledest þe world by certein goủnaunce  
In ydelnesse as men sayn ȝe no þing make  
But lord þese grisely feendly rokkes blake  
That semen raþer a foul confusion̄  
Of werk þen any fayr creacion̄  
Of whiche a parfyt god and a stable  
why han ȝe wrouȝt þis werk vnresonable  
ffor by þis werke south north est and west  
Ther nys y fostred man ne bryd ne best  
hit doþ no good to my witt but annoyeþ  
Se ȝe nouȝt lorde how mankynde it destroyeþ  
An hundreþ þousand bodyes of mankynde
