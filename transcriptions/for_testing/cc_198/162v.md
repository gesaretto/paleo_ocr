That langusshiþ as fuyre doþ in helle  
And deye seyde he moste as did Ekko  
ffor narsisus þat durste nouȝt telle hir wo  
In oþer manere þenne ȝe here me seye  
Ne durst he nouȝt to hire his wo bewreye  
Saue ꝑaduentẽ som tyme at daunces  
There ȝong folk kepen here obẜuaunces  
hit may wel be he loked on hire face  
In such a wise as man þat asked grace  
But no þing wiste sche of his entent  
Naþeles it happed or þey þennes went  
By cause þat he was hire neyȝebõre  
And was a man of worschipe and honõ  
And hadde knowen him ofte times ȝore  
þey felle in speche ofte more and more  
vnto his purpos drowe aurelius  
And whan he saw his tyme he sayde þus  
Ma dame ꝙ he by god þat þis world made  
So þat I wiste it mighte ȝour herte glade  
I wolde þat day þat ȝour arueragus  
wente on þe see þat I aurelius  
had went þat I schulde neuer haue come aȝain  
ffor wel I woot my seruise is in vayn  
My guerdon̄ nys but berstyng of myn herte  
Ma dame reweþ vpon my peynes smerte  
ffor as wiþ a swerd ȝe may me sle or saue  
her at ȝoure foot god wolde þat I were graue  
I haue as now no more leysir for to seye  
haue mercy on me swete or ȝe wolen do me deye  
Sche gan to loke vpon aurelius  
Is þis ȝoure wille ꝙ sche and say ȝe þus  
Neuer erst ꝙ sche ne wist I what ȝe mente  
But now aurely I knowe ȝoure entente  
By þilke god þat ȝaf me soule and lyf  
Ne schal I neuer be vntrewe wyf  
In word ne in werk as fer as I haue wit
