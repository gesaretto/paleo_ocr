I wolen ben his to whom þat I am knyt  
But after þat in pleyn þus seyde sche  
Tak þis for fynal answer as for me  
Aurely qd sche by hihe god aboue  
ȝit wol I günte ȝou to be ȝoure loue  
Seþyns I ȝou se so pitously compleyne  
loke what day þat engelond is Bryteyne  
ȝe remewe all þe rokkes ston by stoon  
þat þay ne lette schip ne boot to goon  
I say whan ȝe han made þere costes so clene  
Of Rokkes þat þer nys no ston y sene  
þan wol I loue ȝou best of any man  
haue here my trouþe in al þat euer I can  
Is þere non oþer grace qd he  
No by þat lord quod sche þat made me  
ffor wel I wot þat þat schal neuer betyde  
let such folye out of ȝour herte glyde  
what deynte schulde man haue by his lijf  
ffor to loue anoþ̉ mannes wyf  
That haþ hir body whan so þat him likeþ  
aurelius fulofte sore sikeþ  
wo was aurely whan þat he þis herde  
and wiþ a sorwful herte þus answerde  
ma dame qd he þis were impossible  
Thenne mot I deye on sodeyn deþ orrible  
And wiþ þat word he torned him anon  
þo came hire oþer frendes many oon  
and in þe aleyes romed vp and don̄  
and no þing wiste of þis conclusion̄
But sodeinly bygan to reuel newe  
Til þat þe brighte sonne loste his hewe  
ffor thorisowte haþ raft þe sonne his light  
þis is as moche to say as it was night  
and home þey gon in Ioye and in solas  
Saue oonly wrecched aurelius allas  
he to his hous is gon wiþ sorwful herte
