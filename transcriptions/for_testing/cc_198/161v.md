han rokkes slayn al be þey nouȝt in mynde  
which mankynde is a fair part of þy werk  
That þou it madest y like to þin hond werk  
Thenne semed it ȝe hadde a gret chierte  
Toward mankynde byt how þan may it be  
That ȝe suche menys make it to distroyen  
whiche menys doþ no good but euer annoyen  
I wot wel clerkes woln sayn as hem leste  
By argumentz þat al þing is for þe beste  
Though I ne can þe causes for soþe knowe  
but þilke god þat made wynd to blowe  
as kepe my lord þis is my conclusion̄  
To clerkes lete I al disputacion̄  
But wolde god þat aỻ þe rokkes blake  
were sonken in to helle for his sake  
There rokkes sleen mȳ herte for feere  
Thus wolde sche sayn with many a pitous teere  
hire freendes sawe þat nas no disport  
To romen by þe see but discomfort  
And schopen for to pleyen som where elles  
þey leden hire by Ryueres and by welles  
And eek in oþer places delitables  
þey daunce and pleye at Chesse and at tables  
So on a day right on þe morne tyde  
vnto a gardyne þat was right þere besyde  
In which þat þay hadde made here ordynance  
Of vitaile and of oþer puruyaunce  
They gon and pleyen hem al þe longe day  
And þis was on þe sixte morwe of may  
Which may hadde peynted wiþ his softe schoures  
This gardyn ful of leues and of floures  
And wiþ crafte of mannes hande so curiously  
Arayed haþ þis gardyn trayelly  
That neuer nas þer gardyn of such prys  
But if it were þe verrey paradys  
The odure of floures and þe freisshe sight
