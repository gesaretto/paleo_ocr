And so do men if I þe soþe seye schal  
loke who þat is most pacient in loue  
he is at his auauntage aboue  
Pacience is an heih vertu certeyn  
ffor it venquissheþ as þese clerkes seyn  
Thynges þat Rigor schulde neuer atteigne  
ffor euery word men may nouȝt chyde ne pleyne  
lerneþ to suffre or elles so mote I gon  
ȝe schullen it lerne wheþer ȝe wole or non  
ffor in þis worlde certeyn no wight nys  
þat he ne doþ or saiþ sumtyme amys  
Or oþir siknesse oþer constillacion̄  
wyn wo or chaungyng of complexion̄  
Causeþ ful often to don amys oþer speken  
On euery wrong men may nouȝt ben awreken  
After þe tyme moste be temꝑaunce  
To euery wight þat can no gouernance  
And þerfore haþ þis worþy wise knight  
To lyue in ese suffraunce hire behight  
And sche to him ful wisly gan to swere  
That neuer schulde þer be defaute in here  
here may men sen an humble wyse acord  
Thus haþ sche take hire seruan̄t and hire lord  
Seruaunt in loue and lord in mariage  
Then was he boþe in lordschipe and ẜuage  
Seruage nay but in lordschipe aboue  
Seþyns þat he haþ boþe his lady and his loue  
his lady certes and his wyf also  
The whiche þat lawe of loue acordeþ þer to  
And whan he was in þis ꝓsꝑite  
home wiþ his wyf he goþ to his cuntre  
Nouȝt fer fro pedmark þer as his dwellyng was  
wher as he lyueþ in blisse and in solas  
who couþe telle but he hadde wedded be  
þe ioye þe ese and þe ꝓsperite  
That is bitwixe an housebond and his wyf
