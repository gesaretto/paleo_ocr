Column 2:

And stonde as on amonges all  
which am out of hir grace fall  
It nedeþ take no witnesse  
ffor sche which seid is þe goddesse  
To wheþer part of loue it wende  
haþ set me for a final ende  
The point wherto þat I schal holde  
ffor whan sche hath me wel beholde  
haluynge of scorn sche seide þus  
þou wost wol þat I am Venus  
which al only my lustes seche  
And well I wot þough þou beseche   
My loue. lustes be þer none   
which I may take in þy ꝑsone  
My loue lust. and lokkes hore  
In chambre acorden neủe more  
and þough þou feigne a yong corrage  
It scheweþ wel be þe visage  
þat olde Griseỻ is no fole  
Ther ben ful many yeeres stole  
wiþ þe and suche oþre mo  
þat outward feignen youthe so  
And ben wiþinne of poure assay   
Myn herte wolde and I ne may  
Is nought beloued now a dayes  
Er þou make eny suche assaies  
To loue. and faile vppon þe fet  
Bettre is to make a beau retret  
ffor þough þou mightest loue atteyne   
yit were it but an ydel peyne  
whan þat þou art not sufficant  
To holde loue his couenant  
ffor þy tak hom þin herte ayein  
þat þou trauaile nought in Vein  
wher of my court may be deceyued  
I wot and haue wel conceyued   
how þat þy wille is good ynough   
But more behoueþ to þe plough  
wherof þe lackeþ as I trowe  
So sit it wel þat þou beknowe   
þy feble estat er þou begynne  
þing wher þou might non ende wynne  
what bargayn schulde a man assaie  
whan þat him lackeþ for to paie   
My sone is þat þou wel be þought  
This toucheþ þe foryet it nought
