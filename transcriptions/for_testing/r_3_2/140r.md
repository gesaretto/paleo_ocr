Column 1:

To Ephesim he had him drawe  
And as it was þat time lawe  
he schal do þer his sacrifise  
And ek he bad in all wise  
That in þe temple amonges alle  
his fortune as it is befalle  
Touching his doughter and his wif  
he schal be knowe vpon his lif  
The kynde of þis auision̄  
haþ gret ymachinacion̄  
what þing it signifie may  
And naþeles whan it was day  
he bad caste anker and abod  
and whil þat he on anker rod  
The wynd which was tofore stn̈ge  
vppon þe poynt began to change  
And torneþ þider as it scholde  
þo knew he wel þͭ god it wolde  
And bad þe maister make him yare  
Tofore þe wynd for he wol fare  
To Ephesim and so he dede  
And whan he cam in to þe stede  
wher as he scholde londe he londeþ  
wiþ al þe haste he may he fondeþ  
To schapen him be such a wise  
þat he may be þe morwe arise  
and don aftir þe mandement  
Of him which haþ him þider sent  
And in þe wise þat he þought  
vppon þe morwe so he wrought  
his doughter and his sone he nom  
and forþ vnto þe temple he com  
wiþ a gret route in compaignie  
his yiftes for to sacrifie  
þe Citezeins þo herden seie  
Of such a king þat cam to preie  
vnto Diane þe goddesse  
And left all oþur busynesse  
þey comen þider for to se  
þe kyng. and þe solempnite  
With worþy knightes enVironed  
The king himself hath abandoned  
In to þe temple in good entente  
þe dore is vppe and in he wente  
wher as with gret deuocion̄  
Of holy contemplacion̄  

Column 2:

wiþinne his herte he made his schrifte  
And aftir þat a riche yifte  
he offreth with gret reuerence  
And þer in open euidence  
Of hem þat stooden al aboute  
he tolde hem and declareþ oute  
his happ such as him is bifall  
Ther was no þing foryete of all  
his wijf as it was goddes g̈ce  
which was ꝓfessed in þe place  
As sche þat was Abbesse þere  
vnto his tale haþ leid hir eere  
Sche knewe þe voys and þe visage  
ffor pure ioye as in a rage  
Sche straught vnto him al attones  
And fell aswoune vppon þe stones  
Wher of þe temple floor was paued  
She was anon with watir laued  
Til sche cam to hir self ayein  
And þanne sche bigan to sein  
ha blessed be þe hihe sonde  
þat I may se mȳ housebonde  
which whilom he and I were on  
The king with þat knewe hire anon  
And tok hir in his arm and kiste  
And al þe toun þus sone it wiste  
Tho was þer ioye many fold  
ffor eủy man þis tale haþ told.  
As for miracle and weren glade  
But neủe man such ioye made  
As doþ þe king which haþ his wijf  
and whan men herde how þat her lijf  
was saued. and by whom it was  
þey wondren all of such a cas  
þorugh al þe lond arros þe speche  
Of maister Cerimon þe leche  
And of þe cure which he dide  
The king himself so hath him bede  
And eek þe queene forþ with him  
þat he þe toun of Ephesim   
wol leue. and go wher as þey be  
ffor neủe man of his degre  
haþ don to hem so mochel good  
and he his ꝓfit vndirstood  
and günteþ with hem for to wende  
And þus þey made þer an ende
