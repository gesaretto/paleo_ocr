To do me g̈ce of þilke sweete tonne  
which vnder keie in his celer amidde  
lith couched. þat fortune is ouerronne  
But of þe bitter cuppe I haue begonne  
I not how ofte. and þus I finde no game  
ffor eủe I axe. and eủe it is the same  
I se the world stonde eủe vppon eschange  
now wyndes lowde ⁊ now þe weder softe  
I may sen ek þe grete moone chānge  
and þing which now is lowe is eft alofte  
þe dredful werres in to pees fulofte.    
þey torne and eủ is danger in o place   
which wol not chānge his wil to do me g̈ce  
But vppon þis þe grete clerk OVide  
Of loue whan he makþ his remembn̈ce  
he seith þ̉ is þe blinde god Cupide  
þe which. haþ loue vnd̉ his goủnance  
And in his hond wiþ many a firy lance  
he woundeþ ofte wher he wol nought hele.  
And þͭ somdel is cause of my querele  
OVide ek seiþ þͭ loue to parforne  
Stant in þe hond of Ven9 þe goddesse  
but whan sche takþ hir cōnseil wͭ satorne  
þer is no g̈ce. and in þat time I gesse  
Began my loue. of which mȳ heuynesse.  
Is now and eủe schal but if I speede  
So wot I nought myself what is to rede  
For þi to yow Cupide and Ven9 boþe  
wͭ al mȳ hertes obeissance I p̉ie    
If ye were atte ferste time wroþe  
whan I began to loue as I yow seye   
now stynte and do þis infortune aweie    
So þͭ dang̉ which stant of retenue.  
wiþ my lady. his place may remue  
O þou Cupide god of loues lawe  
þat wiþ þi dart brennyng hast set a fir̉    
mȳ herte. do þͭ won̄de be wiþdrawe  
Or yiue me salue such as I desir̉  
ffor seruice in þy court wiþoutē hire  
To me which eủe yit haue kept þin heste  
may neủe be to loues lawe honeste  
O þou gentil ven9 loues queene  
wiþoutē gilt þou dost on me þi wreche  
þou wost my peyne is eủe a liche grene.  
ffor loue. yit I may it nought areche  
þis wolde I for my laste word beseche  

Column 2:

That þou my loue aquite as I deserue  
Or elles do me pleinly for to sterue  
Whan I þis supplantacion̄  
wiþ good deliberacion̄  
In such a wise as ye now wite  
haþ aftir mȳ entente write  
vnto Cupide and to Venus  
This prest which highte Genius  
It tok on honde to p̉sente  
On my message and forþ he wente  
To Venus for to wite hir wille  
And I bood in þe place stille  
And was þer but alitel while  
nought fuỻ þe mountance of a myle  
whan I behield and sodeinly  
I sigh wher Venus stood me by   
So as I mighte vndir a tree  
To grounde I feỻ vpon my kne  
And preide hir for to do me g̈ce  
Sche caste hire chier vppon my face  
And as it were haluyng againe  
Sche axeþ me what was my name  
Ma dame I seide Iohn̈ Gower  
Now Iohn̈ quoþ sche in my power  
þou most as of þi loue stonde  
ffor I þy bille haue vnderstonde  
In which to Cupide and to me  
Somdel þou hast compleyned þe  
And somdel to natur̉ also  
But þat schal stonde among yow tuo  
ffor þ̉ of haue I nought to done  
ffor nature is vnder þe moone  
maystresse for eủe lyues kynde  
But it so be þat sche may fynde  
Som holy man þat wole wiþdrawe  
his kindely lust ayein hire lawe   
but seelde whanne it falleþ so  
ffor fewe men þ̉ ben of þo  
But of þese oþere yknowe be  
which of here oughne nycete  
Ayein nature and hire office  
Deliten hem in sondry vice  
wherof þat sche fulofte haþ pleigned  
And ek my count it haþ desdeigned  
And eủe schal. for it receyueth  
Non such þat kinde so desteyneþ
