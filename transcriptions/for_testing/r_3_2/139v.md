Column 1:

And putte awey his heuy chiere  
But of hem tuo a man may here  
What is to be so sibbe of blood  
Non wiste of oþ̉ how it stood  
And yit þe fader at þe laste  
his herte vpon þis mayde kaste  
That he hir loueþ kindely  
And yit he wiste neủe why  
But al was knowe er þat þey wente  
ffor god which wot here hol entente  
here hertes boþe anon descloseþ  
This king vnto þis maide opposeþ  
And axeþ first what is hir name  
And wher sche lerned al þis game  
And of what kyn þat sche was come  
And sche þat haþ his wordes nome  
Answreth and seiþ my name is Thaise  
þat was som tyme wel at ayse  
In Thaise I was forth drawe and fed  
þer lerned I til  was sped  
Of þat I can my fader eke  
I not wher þat I scholde him seke  
he was a king men tolden me  
My modir dreint was in þe see  
ffro poynt to poynt al sche him tolde  
þat sche haþ longe in herte holde  
And neủe dorste make hire mone  
But only to þis lord allone  
To whom hire herte can nought hele  
Torne it to wo turne it to wele  
Torne it to good torne it to harm  
and he þo tok hire in his arm  
But such a ioye as he þo made.    
was neủe seen. þus be þey glade  
That sory hadde be tofore  
ffro þis day forþ fortune haþ swore  
To sette him vpward on þe whel  
So goþ þe world now wo now wel  
This king haþ founde newe g̈ce  
So þat out of his derke place  
he goþ him vp in to þe light  
and wiþ him cam þat swete wight  
his doughter Thaise and forþ anon  
þey boþe in to þe Caban gon.  
which was ordeyned for þe king  
and þer he dede of al his þing  

Column 2:

And was arraied really  
And out he cam al openly  
wher Athenagoras he fond  
The which was lord of al þe lond  
he preiþ þe king to come and se  
his castel boþe and his Citee  
And þus þei gon forth all in feere  
The king þis lord þis maiden dere  
This lord þo made hem riche feste  
with eủy þing which was honeste  
To plese wiþ þis worþy king  
Ther lackeþ him no maner þing  
But yit for al his noble array  
wifles he was in to þat day  
As he þat yit was of yong age  
So fell þer in to his corrage  
The lusty woo þe glade peyne.  
Of loue. which no man restreyne.  
yit neủe mighte. as now tofore  
þis lord þenkþ al his world forlore  
But if þe king wolde don him g̈ce  
he wanteþ time he wanteþ place  
him þoughte his herte wol tobreke  
Til he may to þis maide speke  
And to hir fader ek also.  
ffor mariage and it fell so  
That al was do right as he þoughte  
his pourpos to an ende he broughte  
Sche weddeþ him as for hire lord   
Thus be þey all of on acord  
Whan al was do right as þey wolde  
The king to his sone he tolde  
Of Tharse þilke traiterie  
And seyde how in his compaignie  
his doughter and himseluen eke  
Schul go Vengance for to seke   
The schipes were redy sone  
and whan þey sihe it was to done  
Wiþhoute lette of eny wente   
Wiþ seil vp drawe forth þey wente  
Towardes Thaise vppon þe tyde  
But he þat wot what schal betide  
þe hihe god which wolde him kepe  
whan þat þis king was fast aslepe  
Be nightes tyme he haþ him bede  
To seile in to anoþ̉ stede
