¶But in hir holynesse. helden hem stille  
At Auynoū among þe Iewes. Cum Sc̄o Stūs eris ⁊c̉
Or in Rome as hir rule wole. þe relikes to kepe  
And þow Conscience in kynges court. and sholdest neu̔e come þennes  
And Grace þat þow graddest so of. gyour of alle clerkes  
And Piers wiþ his newe plow. and ek wiþ his olde  
Emꝑour of al þe world. þat alle men were cristene  
¶Inparfit is þat pope. þat al þe world sholde helpe  
And sendeþ swiche þͭ sleeþ hem. þat he sholde saue  
¶And wel worþe Piers þe plowman. þat p̃sueþ god in doynge  
Qui pluit suꝑ Iustos ⁊ iniustos. atones
And sent þe sonne to saue. a cursed mannes tilþe  
As brighte as to þe beste man. or to þe beste wōman  
¶Right so Piers þe Plowman. peyneþ hym to tilye
As wel for a wastour. and wenches of þe stewes
As for hym self and hise s̉uauntz. saue he is first yserued  
And trauailleþ and tilieþ. for a tretour also soore  
As for a trewe tidy man. alle tymes ylike  
And worshiped be he þat wroȝte al. boþe good and wikke  
And suffreþ þat synfulle be  
And god amende þe pope. þat pileþ holy kirke  
And cleymeþ bifore þe kyng. to be kepere ouer cristene  
And counteþ noȝt þouȝ cristene ben. killed and robbed  
And fynt folk to fiȝte. and cristen blood to spille  
Ayein þe olde lawe and newe lawe. as Luc þer of witnesseþ  
Non occides. michi vindictam  ⁊c̉
¶It semeþ bi so. hym self hadde his wille  
That he reccheþ. riȝt noȝt of al þe remenaunt  
And crist of his curteisie. þe Cardinals saue  
And torne hir wit to wisdom. and to welþe of soule
