ffor þi quod g̃ce er I go. I wol gyue yow tresor  
And wepne to fighte wiþ. whan Antecrist yow assaileþ  
And gaf ech man a g̃ce. to gide wiþ hym seluen  
That ydelnesse encombre hym noȝt. enuye ne pride  
Diuisiones graciaɏ sunt [et cetera]  
Some he yaf wit. with wordes to shewe  
wit to wynne hir liflode wiþ. as þe world askeþ  
As p̔chours and preestes. and prentices of lawe  
They lelly to lyue. by labour of tonge  
And by wit to wissen oþere. as g̃ce hem wolde teche  
And some he kennede craft. and konnynge of sighte  
wiþ sellynge and buggynge. hir bilyue to wynne  
And some he lered to laboure. a lele lif and a trewe  
And some he tauȝte to tilie. to dyche and to thecche  
To wynne wiþ hir liflode. bi loore of his techynge  
And some to deuyne and diuide. noumbres to kenne  
And some to compace craftily. and colours to make  
And some to se and to seye. what sholde bifalle  
Boþe of wele and of wo. telle it er it felle  
As astronomyens þoruȝ
