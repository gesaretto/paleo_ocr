To helpe holy chirche. and hem þͭ it kepeþ  
¶Thanne alle kynne cristene. saue comune wōmen  
Repenteden and refused synne. saue þei one  
And false men flatereris. Vsurers and peues  
Lyeris and questemong̉es. þat were forsworen ofte  
witynge and wilfully. wiþ þe false helden  
And for siluer were forswore. sooþly þei wiste it
¶Ther nas no cristene creature. þat kynde wit hadde.  
Saue sherewes one. swiche as I spak of  
That he no halp a quantite. holynesse to wexe  
Some þoruȝ bedes biddynge. and some þoruȝ pilgrymages  
And oþ̔e pryue penaunces. and sōme þoruȝ penyes delynge  
¶And þanne wellede water. for wikkede werkes  
Egreliche errynge. out of mennes eighen  
Clennesse out of commune.
