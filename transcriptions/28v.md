Of Stubbes scharpe and hidous to biholde  
In which þer ran a Rombel in a swougħ  
And þought a storm schulde bresten euerẏ bougħ  
And dounward from an huỻ vnder a bente  
Ther stood þe temple of mars armypotente  
Wrougħt aỻ of burned steel of which þentre  
Was long and streyt and gastly for to see  
And þer out cam a rage and such a vese  
That it made aỻ þe gates for to rese  
The northerne light in atte dores schone  
ﬀor wyndowe on þe waỻ ne was þer none  
Thorugh which men mighte enẏ light discerne  
The dores waren aỻ of Atthemant et̔ne  
ẏchenchede ouertwart and endlong  
Wiþ Iren towgħ and for to make it strong  
Eủy piler þe temple to sustene  
Was tonne gret of Iren bright and scheene  
Ther saẏ I ferst þe derk ẏmagẏnẏnge  
Of felonẏe and al þe compassynge  
The cruel Ire reed as enẏ glede  
The pykpurs and eek þe pale drede  
The smẏler with þe knẏf vnder þe cloke  
The schepene brennẏng with þe blake smoke  
The tresoun of þe morthering in þe bedde  
The open werre wiþ woundes aỻ bibledde  
Contek wiþ bloodẏ knẏf and scharp manace  
Al ful of schrikyng was þat sory place  
The sleer of himself yet saugh I þere  
his herte hath baþed al his here  
The nayl ẏ drẏuen in þe schood on night  
The colde deth wiþ mouþ gapende vprighte  
Amẏddes of þe temple sat meschan̄ce  
With disconfort and sorẏ contenan̄ce  
ẏet saugh I woodnesse laughyng in his rage  
Armed compleint out hees and feers outrage  
The karoigne in þe busk wiþ þrote ẏ korue
