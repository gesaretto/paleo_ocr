Of Stubbes scharpe and hidous to biholde  
In which þer ran a Rombel in a swough  
And þought a storm schulde bresten euery bough  
And dounward from an hull vnder a bente  
Ther stood þe temple of mars armypotente  
wrought all of burned steel of which þentre  
was long and streyt and gastly for to see  
And þer out cam a rage and such a vese  
That it made all þe gates for to rese  
The northerne light in atte dores schone  
ffor wyndowe on þe wall ne was þer none  
Thorugh which men mighte eny light discerne  
The dores waren all of Atthemant et̔ne  
ychenchede ouertwart and endlong  
wiþ Iren towgh and for to make it strong  
Eu̔y piler þe temple to sustene  
was tonne gret of Iren bright and scheene  
Ther say I ferst þe derk ymagynynge  
Of felonye and al þe compassynge  
The cruel Ire reed as eny glede  
The pykpurs and eek þe pale drede  
The smyler with þe knyf vnder þe cloke  
The schepene brennyng with þe blake smoke  
The tresoun of þe morthering in þe bedde  
The open werre wiþ woundes all bibledde  
Contek wiþ bloody knyf and scharp manace  
Al ful of schrikyng was þat sory place  
The sleer of himself yet saugh I þere  
his herte hath baþed al his here  
The nayl y dryuen in þe schood on night  
The colde deth wiþ mouþ gapende vprighte  
Amyddes of þe temple sat meschan̄ce  
with disconfort and sory contenan̄ce  
yet saugh I woodnesse laughyng in his rage  
Armed compleint out hees and feers outrage  
The karoigne in þe busk wiþ þrote y korue
