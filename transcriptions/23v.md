And sle me in þis woode þer I am Inne    
Thou mayst wel haue þy lady as for me  
This Palamon answerd I graunt it þe  
A þus þei ben departed til a morwe  
Whan ech of hem hadde leyd his feiþ to borwe  
Occupied out of alle charite  
O regne þat wolde no felawe haue with þe  
ﬀul soþ is seid þat loue ne lorschipe  
Wol not his þankes haue no felaschipe  
We fynde þat of arcite and Palamon  
Arcite is riden anon in to þe toun  
And so þe morwe er it were dayes light  
ﬀul priuely tuo herneys haþ he dight  
Boþe sufficant and meete to darreyne  
The batail in þe feld bitwix hem tweyne  
And on his hors allone as he was borne  
He carieth al his harneys him biforne  
And in þe groue at tyme and place yset  
This arcite and þis Palamon ben mette  
To changen gan þe colour in hire face  
Right as þe hunters in þe Reigne of trace  
That stondeþ atte gappe with a spere  
Whan hunted is þe leoun or þe bere  
And heereþ him come russhing in þe greeues  
And bereþ boþe bowes and þe leeues  
And þinkeþ here comeþ my mortel enemy  
Wiþoute faile he moot be deed or I  
ﬀor eiþer I mot sleen him atte gappe  
Or he mot slee me if þat me mys happe  
So ferden þei in chaungyng of here hewe  
As fer as euerich of hem oþer knewe
Ther nas no good day ne no saluynge  
But streit wiþouten word or rehersynge  
Euerich of hem hilp for to arme oþer  
As freendly as he were his owne broþer  
And after þat wiþ scharpe speres stronge
