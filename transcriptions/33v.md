As don þese wete brondes in here brennynge  
And at þe brondes ende out ran anon  
As it were bloody dropes many on  
ffor which so sore a gast was Emelye  
That sche was ful ny mad and gan to crie  
ffor sche ne wiste what it signefied  
But oonly for þe feer þus haþ sche cried  
And weepe þat it was pite for to heere  
And þer with al Diane gan appeere  
with bowe in hand right as an hunteresse  
And seyde doughter stynt þin heuynesse  
Among þe goddes heigh it is affermed  
And by eterne word writen and confermed  
Thou schalt be wedded vnto oon of þo  
þat han for þe so mochel care and wo  
And vnto which of hem I may not telle  
ffar wel for I ne may no lenger dwelle  
The fyres which þat on myn auter breme  
Schul þe declare ar þat ȝe gon henne  
Thin auenture of loue as in þis caas  
And wiþ þat word þe arwes in þe caas  
Of þe goddesse clateren faste and rynge  
And forþ sche wente and made a vanysschynge  
ffor which þis Emelye astoned was  
And seide what amonteþ þis allas  
I putt me in þi ꝓteccion̄  
Diane and in þi disposicion̄  
And home sche goþ anon þe nexte weye  
This is þeffecte þer nys namore to seye  
The nexte hour of mars folwynge þis  
Arcite vnto te temple walked is  
Of fiers mars to don his sacrifise  
wiþ all þe rites of his payen wise  
wiþ pitous hert and heigh deuocion̄  
Right þus to mars he seide his orison̄  
O stronge god þat in þe regnes colde
