And þough he ferst for Ire quook and sterte  
he haþ considered schortly in a clause  
The trespas of hem bothe and eek þe cause  
And al þough þat his Ire hire gilt accused  
ȝit in his reson̄ he hem boþe excused
As þus he þoughte wel þat eủy man  
Wil helpe himself in loue if þat he can  
And eek deliuere himself out of p̉son̄  
And eek his herte hadde compassion̄  
Of wommē for þeẏ wepen euer in oon  
And in his gentil herte he þought anon  
And softe vnto himself he seide fẏ  
vpon a lord þat wol haue no mercẏ  
But be a leon̄ boþe in word and dede  
To hem þat ben in repentance and drede  
As wel as to a proud dispitous man  
That wol maintene þat he first bigan  
That lord haþ litel of discrecion̄  
That in such cas can no diuision̄  
But weẏeth pride and humblesse after oon  
And schortlẏ whan his Ire is þus goon  
he gan to loken vp with eẏghen ligħt  
And spak þis same wordes al on higħt  
¶ The god of loue a benedicite  
How mightẏ and how gret a lord is he  
Aȝeins his might þer gaẏneþ non obstacles  
He maẏ be cleped a god of his miracles  
ﬀor he can maken at his owne gise  
Of euerich herte as þat him list deuise  
lo her þis arcite and þis Palamon  
That quẏtly were out of mẏ p̉son  
And might haue lyued in Thebes rially  
And witen I am here mortel enemy  
And þat here deþ lith in mẏ might also  
And ȝit haþ loue maugre here ẏghen tuo  
Brought hem hider boþe for to deẏe
