And euerich of vs take his auenture  
Gret was þe strif and long bitwix hem tweẏe  
If þat I hadde leyser for to seie  
But to þis effect it happed on a day  
To telle it ȝou as schortlẏ as I may  
A worþi duk þat highte Ꝑotheus  
That felawe was vnto duk Theseus  
Sẏn þilke daẏ þat þai were children lite  
Was come to Athenes his felawe to visite  
and for to pleẏe as he was wont to do  
ﬀor in þis world he loued noman so  
And he loued him als tendurlẏ agaẏn  
So wel þei loued as olde bokes sayn  
That whan þat oon was ded soþly to telle  
his felaw went and sought him doun in helle  
But of þat storẏ list me nought to write  
Duk Ꝑotheus louede wel arcite  
And had him knowe at Thebes þer be yere  
And finallẏ at request and preẏere  
Of Ꝑotheus wiþoute onẏ Raunsōn̄  
Duk Theseus him leet out of prisōn̄  
ﬀrely to gon wher þat him list ouer al  
In such a gise as I ȝou telle schal  
This was þe forware pleinlẏ for tendite  
Bitwixe Theseus and him Arcite  
That if so were þat arcite were founde  
Euer in his lif bẏ daẏ or night or stounde  
In enẏ contre of þis Theseus  
And he were caught it was accorded þus  
That with a swerd he scholde leese his heed  
Ther nas non oþer remedie ne reed  
But takeþ his leeue and homward he him spedde  
Lat him be war his nekke liþ to wedde  
How gret a sorwe suﬀreþ now arcite  
The deth he feeleþ þurgh his herte smẏte  
He wepeþ.weẏleth.crieþ pitously
