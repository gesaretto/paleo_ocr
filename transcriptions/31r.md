Couered in cloth of gold diapred weel  
Com ridẏng lyk þe god of armes mars  
His cote armure was of cloþ of Tars  
Couched with perles whit and round and grete  
His sadel was of brent gold newe I bete  
A mantelet vpon his schuldern̄ hangẏnge  
Bret ful of Rubẏes reede as fyr sparclẏnge  
His crispe her lik rẏnges was I ronne  
And þat was ẏelow and glitering as þe sonne  
His nose was highe his eyen bright Cẏtrẏn  
His lippes rounde his colour was sanguẏn  
A fewe frakenes in his face ẏ spreẏnd  
Betwixe ẏelow and somdel blak ẏ meynd  
And as a leon̄ he his lokyng caste  
Of fẏue and twentẏ ȝeer his age I caste  
His berd was wel begonne for to springe  
His voẏs was as a trompe thunderinge  
vpon his heed he wered a laurer grene  
A garland freissche and lustẏ for to seene  
vpon his hand he bar for his deduẏt  
An Egle tame as enẏ lilie whit  
And C. lordes hadde he with him þere  
Aỻ armed saue here heedes in al here gere  
ﬀul richelẏ in aỻ maner þinges  
ﬀor trusteþ wel þat Dukes Erles kẏnges  
Were gadred in þis noble companẏe  
ﬀor loue and for encrees of chiualrie  
aboute þis king þer ran on eủrẏ part  
ﬀul manẏ a tame leon̄ and lepart  
And in þis wise þise lordes aỻ and some  
Ben on þe sonedaẏ to þe Cite come  
Aboute p̉me and in þe toun alighte  
This Theseus þis Duk þis worþi knighte  
Whan he hadde brought hem in to his Cite  
And Inned hem eủich at his degre  
He festeþ hem and doþ so gret labour
