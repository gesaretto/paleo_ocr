Ne yet þe folie of king Salomon  
Ne ȝit þe grete strengþe of Hercules  
Thenchauntementz of Medea and Circes  
Ne of Turnus wiþ þe hardẏ fiers corrage  
The riche Crẏsus kaẏtif in seruage  
Thus maẏ ȝe seen þat Wisdom ne richesse  
Beaute ne sleighte strengþe ne hardẏnesse  
Ne maẏ wiþ venus holde chamꝑtye  
ﬀor as hire list þe world þanne maẏ sche gye  
lo aỻ þise folk so kaught were in here lace  
Til þei for woo ful ofte seẏde allase  
Suﬀiseth here ensamples oon or tuo  
And þough I couþe rekne a þousand mo  
The statue of venus glorious for to see  
Was inaked fleetẏng in þe large see  
And fro þe nauel doun al couered was  
Wiþ wawes greene and bright as enẏ glas  
O citole in hir right hond hadde sche  
And on hire heed fil semelẏ for to see  
A rose garlond freissch and wel smellynge  
Aboue hir heed hir doufes flykerynge  
Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido  
vpon his schuldernes wenges hadde he tuo  
And blynd he was as it is ofte seene  
A bowe he bar and arwes bright and keene  
Whi schulde I nought as wel eek telle þe halle  
The purtraiture þat was vpon þe walle  
Wiþinne þe temple of mightẏ mars þe reede  
Al peynted was þe wal in lengþe and brede  
lik to þe eestres of þe grisly place  
That highte þe grete temple of Mars in trace  
In þilke colde frostẏ regioun  
Ther as Mars haþ his soủaigne mansion̄  
ﬀirst on þe wal was peynted a foreste  
In which þer dwelled neyþer man ne beste  
Wiþ knottẏ knarrẏ bareyne trees olde
