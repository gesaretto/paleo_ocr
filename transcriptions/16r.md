And þer with al he bleynt and crẏed a  
As þough he stongen were unto þe herte  
And with þat crẏe Arcite anon up sterte  
And seide Cosyn myn what eẏleþ þe  
That art so pale and dedly on to se  
Whẏ crẏdestow who haþ þe don offence  
ﬀor goddes love tak al in pacience  
Oure p̉soun for it maẏ non oþer be  
ﬀortune haþ ẏiue us þis aduersite  
Som wicke aspect or disposiciōn̄  
Of Saturne bẏ som constellaciōn̄  
Haþ ȝiuen vs þis al þough we had it sworn  
So stood þe heuen whan þat we ware born  
We mote endure it þis is schort and plaẏn  
This Palamon answerd and seide again  
Cosyn for soþe of þis opynion  
Þou hast a vain imaginacion  
This p̉son̄ causede me nought to crie    
But I was hurt right now þorugħ out myn ẏhe    
In to myn hert þat wol mẏ bane be  
The faẏrnesse of þat ladẏ þat I see  
Ȝonde in the gardẏn rome to and fro  
Is cause of al mẏ crẏing and mẏ wo  
I not wher sche be wōman or goddesse
But Venus is it sothlẏ as I gesse  
And þer with al on knees a doun he fille    
And seyde Venus if it be þẏ wille  
ẏow in þis gardeyn þus to tñsfigure  
Bẏfore me sorwful wrecched creature  
Out of þis prison̄ help þat we mowe scape  
And if so be mẏ destenẏe be schape  
Bẏ eterne world to deẏen in p̉son̄  
Of oure lynage haue som compassion̄  
That is so lowe ẏ brougħt bẏ tyrannie  
And with þat word Arcite gan aspẏe  
Wher as þis ladẏ romed to and fro
