That haþ destroyed wel neyh al þe blood  
Of Thebes with his waste walles wide  
And venus sleeþ me on þat oþer syde  
ﬀor Ialousye and fere of him Arcite  
¶ Now will I stynte of Palamon alite  
And lat him in his prison̄ stille dwelle  
And of Arcite forþ I wil ȝou telle  
The somer passeþ and þe nightes longe  
Encresceth double wise þe peẏnes stronge   
Boþe of þe louer and of þe prisoner   
I not which haþ þe wofuller mẏster   
ﬀor schortly for to sein of Palamon  
Ꝑpetuelly is dampned to prison  
In cheynes and in fettres to þe ded  
And arcite is exiled vp his hed  
ﬀor euermore as out of þat contre  
Ne neuer he ne schal his ladẏ se  
¶ yow louers aske I now þis question̄  
Who haþ þe wors arcite or Palamon  
That oon maẏ seen his ladẏ daẏ bẏ daẏ  
But in prison̄ moot he duellen aẏ  
That oþer wher him list maẏ ride or go  
But seen his ladẏ schal he neuer mo  
Now diuineth as ȝou list þat ȝe can  
ﬀor I wol telle forth as I bigan  
Whan that arcite to Thebes comen was  
ﬀul ofte a daẏ he swelte and saide allas  
ﬀor seen his ladẏ schal he neuere more  
And schortly to concluden al his wo  
So mochel sorwe hadde neuer creature  
That is or schal whil þat þe world maẏ dure  
His sleep. his mete. his drink is him bẏ raft  
That lene he wex and drẏe as is a schaft  
His ẏghen holwe and grislẏ to biholde  
His hewe falwe and pale as aẏssche colde  
And solitarie he was and euer allone
