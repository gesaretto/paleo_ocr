That haþ destroyed wel neyh al þe blood  
Of Thebes with his waste walles wide  
And venus sleeþ me on þat oþer syde  
ffor Ialousye and fere of him Arcite  
¶ Now will I stynte of Palamon alite  
And lat him in his prison̄ stille dwelle  
And of Arcite forþ I wil ȝou telle  
The somer passeþ and þe nightes longe  
Encresceth double wise þe peynes stronge   
Boþe of þe louer and of þe prisoner   
I not which haþ þe wofuller myster   
ffor schortly for to sein of Palamon  
Ꝑpetuelly is dampned to prison  
In cheynes and in fettres to þe ded  
And arcite is exiled vp his hed  
ffor euermore as out of þat contre  
Ne neuer he ne schal his lady se  
¶ yow louers aske I now þis question̄  
Who haþ þe wors arcite or Palamon  
That oon may seen his lady day by day  
But in prison̄ moot he duellen ay  
That oþer wher him list may ride or go  
But seen his lady schal he neuer mo  
Now diuineth as ȝou list þat ȝe can  
ffor I wol telle forth as I bigan  
Whan that arcite to Thebes comen was  
fful ofte a day he swelte and saide allas  
ffor seen his lady schal he neuere more  
And schortly to concluden al his wo  
So mochel sorwe hadde neuer creature  
That is or schal whil þat þe world may dure  
His sleep. his mete. his drink is him by raft  
That lene he wex and drye as is a schaft  
His yghen holwe and grisly to biholde  
His hewe falwe and pale as ayssche colde  
And solitarie he was and euer allone
