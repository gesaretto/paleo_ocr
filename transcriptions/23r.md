ﬀor whom þat I haue al þis peẏne and wo  
And art mẏ blood and to mẏ counseil sworn  
As I ful ofte haue told þe heer biforn  
And hast be iaped here duk Theseus  
And falslẏ chaunged hast þi name þus  
I wol be ded or elles þou schalt dẏe  
Thou schalt not loue mẏ ladẏ Emelye  
But I wol loue hire oonlẏ and nomo  
ﬀor I am Palamon þi mortel foo  
And þough þat I no wepene haue in þis place  
But out of p̉soun am astert bẏ grace  
I drede nought þat ouþer þou schalt die  
Or þou ne schalt not louen Emelye  
Chees which þou wilt or þou schalt not asterte  
This arcite with ful dispitous herte  
When he him knew and hadde his tale herde  
As fers as leon̄ pulled out a swerde  
And seide þus bẏ god þa fitteþ aboue  
Nere it were þat þou art sike and wood for loue  
And eek þat þou no wepne hast in þis place  
Thou schuldest neuer out of þis groue pace  
That þou ne schuldest deẏen of mẏn honde  
ﬀor I diﬀie þe sewrte and þe bonde  
Which þat þou seist I haue maad to þe  
What verraẏ fool þink weel þat loue is fre  
And I wol loue hir maugre al þi might  
But for as moche þou art a worþẏ knigħt  
And willest to derreyne hir by batayle  
Haue her my trouþe to morwe I wol nougħt fayle  
Wiþouten witẏng of enẏ oþer wigħt  
That heer I wol be founden as a knigħt  
And bringen herneẏs right ẏnough for þe  
And chese þe beste and lef þe worste for me  
And mete and drynk þis night wol ẏ bringe  
ynough for þe and cloþes for þi beddynge  
And if so be þat þou mẏ ladẏ wynne
