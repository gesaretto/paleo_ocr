And som wil haue a pruce scheld or a targe  
Som wol ben armed on his legges wel  
and haue an axe and som a mace of steel  
Ther nẏs no newe gẏse þat it nas olde  
Armed were þei as I haue ȝou tolde  
Euerich after his opẏnioun  
Ther maystow see comẏng wiþ Palamon̄  
ligurge himself þe grete king of trace  
Blak was his berd and manlẏ was his face  
The cercles of his ẏhen in his heede  
Thei gloweden bitwixe yelow and rede  
And lik a griffon̄ loked he aboute  
With kempe heres on his browes stoute  
his lẏmes grete his braunes harde and strong  
his schuldernes brode his armes round and long  
And as þe gyse was in his cuntre  
ﬀul heighe vpon a chaar of gold stood he  
Wiþ foure white boles in þe trays  
In stede of cote armour ouer his harnaẏs  
Wiþ naẏles ẏelowe and bright as enẏ golde  
he hadde a berskẏnne coleblak for olde  
his longe her was kembed bẏhynde his bak  
As enẏ rauenes feþer it schon for blak  
A wreþe of gold arme gret of huge weight  
vpon his heed sette ful of stones bright  
Of fyne Rubies and of Diamantz  
Aboute hs chaar þer wente wit Alantz  
Twentẏ and mo as gret as enẏ steere  
To hunten atte leon̄ or þe deere  
And folwed him with mosel fast ẏ bounde  
Coleres of gold and torettes filed rounde  
And C. lordes haddes he in his route  
Armed ful wel wiþ hertes sterne and stoute  
¶ Wiþ arcita in stories as men fynde  
vpon a steede baẏ trapped in steel
