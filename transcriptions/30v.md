And som wil haue a pruce scheld or a targe  
Som wol ben armed on his legges wel  
and haue an axe and som a mace of steel  
Ther nys no newe gyse þat it nas olde  
Armed were þei as I haue ȝou tolde  
Euerich after his opynioun  
Ther maystow see comyng wiþ Palamon̄  
ligurge himself þe grete king of trace  
Blak was his berd and manly was his face  
The cercles of his yhen in his heede  
Thei gloweden bitwixe yelow and rede  
And lik a griffon̄ loked he aboute  
With kempe heres on his browes stoute  
his lymes grete his braunes harde and strong  
his schuldernes brode his armes round and long  
And as þe gyse was in his cuntre  
fful heighe vpon a chaar of gold stood he  
Wiþ foure white boles in þe trays  
In stede of cote armour ouer his harnays  
Wiþ nayles yelowe and bright as eny golde  
he hadde a berskynne coleblak for olde  
his longe her was kembed byhynde his bak  
As eny rauenes feþer it schon for blak  
A wreþe of gold arme gret of huge weight  
vpon his heed sette ful of stones bright  
Of fyne Rubies and of Diamantz  
Aboute hs chaar þer wente wit Alantz  
Twenty and mo as gret as eny steere  
To hunten atte leon̄ or þe deere  
And folwed him with mosel fast y bounde  
Coleres of gold and torettes filed rounde  
And C. lordes haddes he in his route  
Armed ful wel wiþ hertes sterne and stoute  
¶ Wiþ arcita in stories as men fynde  
vpon a steede bay trapped in steel
