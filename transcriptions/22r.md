May with all þi floures whit and grene  
welcome be þou faire freisshe may  
I hope þat I som grene gete may  
And from his courser with a lusty herte  
In to þe groue ful hastily he sterte  
And in a path he rometh vp and doun  
Ther as by auentur̉ of þis Palamon  
was in a busshe þat no man might him see  
ffor sore aferd of his deth was he  
No þing ne knewe he þat it was arcite  
God wot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite  
But soþ is seide go siþþen many ȝeeres  
That feeld haþ yhen and þe woode haþ ceres  
It is ful fair a man to bere him euene  
ffor alday meeteþ men at vnsett steuene  
fful litel woot arcite of his felawe  
That was so neigh to herken of his sawe  
ffor in þe busshe he sitteþ now ful stille  
whan þat arcite hadde Romed al his fille  
And songen al þe Roundel lustily  
In to a studie he fel sodeinly  
As doon þese louers in here queynte geeres  
Now in þe croppe and now doun in þe breeres  
Now vp now doun as boket in a welle  
Right as þe friday soþly for to telle  
Now it schineþ and now it reyneþ faste  
Right so gan gery venus ouer caste  
The hertes of hir̉ folk right as hire day  
Is geerful right so chaungeþ sche array  
Seelde is þe fryday al þe wike y like  
¶ whan þat arcite hadde songe he gan to syke  
And sette him doun wiþouten eny more  
Allas quod he þat day þat I was bore  
how longe Iuno þurgh þi cruelte  
wiltow werreien Thebes þe Cite  
Allas y brought is to confusion̄
