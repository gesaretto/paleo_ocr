Maẏ with aỻ þi floures whit and grene  
Welcome be þou faire freisshe maẏ  
I hope þat I som grene gete maẏ  
And from his courser with a lustẏ herte  
In to þe groue ful hastily he sterte  
And in a path he rometh vp and doun  
Ther as bẏ auentur̉ of þis Palamon  
Was in a busshe þat no man migħt him see  
ﬀor sore aferd if his deth was he  
No þing ne knewe he þat it was arcite  
God wot he wolde haue trowed it ful lite  
But soþ is seide go siþþen manẏ ȝeeres  
That feeld haþ ẏhen and þe woode haþ ceres  
It is ful fair a man to bere him euene  
ﬀor aldaẏ meeteþ men at vnsett steuene  
ﬀul litel woot arcite of his felawe  
That was so neigh to herken of his sawe  
ﬀor in þe busshe he sitteþ now ful stille  
Whan þat arcite hadde Romed al his fille  
And songen al þe Roundel lustily  
In to a studie he fel sodeinly  
As doon þese louers in here queẏnte geeres  
Now in þe croppe and now doun in þe breeres  
Now vp now doun as boket in a welle  
Right as þe fridaẏ soþlẏ for to telle  
Now it schineþ and now it reyneþ faste  
Right so gan gerẏ venus ouer caste  
The hertes of hir̉ folk right as hire daẏ  
Is geerful right so chaungeþ sche arraẏ  
Seelde is þe frẏdaẏ al þe wike ẏ like  
¶ Whan þat arcite hadde songe he gan to syke  
And sette him doun wiþouten enẏ more  
Allas quod he þat daẏ þat I was bore  
How longe Iuno þurgh þi cruelte  
Wiltow werrein Thebes þe Cite  
Allas ẏ brought is to confusion̄
