To sleen himself he waẏteþ priuely  
He seide allas þat daẏ þat I was born  
Now is my prison̄ worse þan biforn  
Now is me schape eternaly to dwelle  
Nought in Purgatori but in helle  
Allas þat euer I knew Ꝑotheus  
ﬀor elles hadde I haue dwelled with Theseus  
I fetered in his prison̄ eueremo  
Thanne hadde I ben in blisse and not in woo  
Only þe sight of hire whom þat I serue  
þougħ þat I neuer hire grace maẏ deserue  
Wolde haue ẏ suﬀised right ẏnougħ for me
¶ Oo deere Cosyn Palamon qd he  
Thin is þe victorie of þis auenture  
ﬀul blissefullẏ in prison̄ might þou dure  
In p̉soun certes naẏ but paradys  
Wel haþ fortune torned þe þe dẏs  
That hast þe right of hire and I þabsence  
ﬀor possible is syn þou hast hir p̔sence  
And art a knight a worþi and an able  
That bẏ som caas syn fortune is changeable  
Thou maist somtyme to þi desir atteẏne  
But I þat am exiled and bareẏne  
Of alle grace and in so gret despeire  
That þer nẏs erþe water fyr ne eyre  
Ne creature þat of hem maked is  
That maẏ me helpe or don confort in þis  
Wel ought I sterue in wanhope and distresse  
ﬀare wel my lif mẏ lust and mẏ gladnesse  
Allas whẏ pleẏnen men so in comune  
On purueance of god or of fortune  
That ȝiueth hem ful ofte in manẏ a gẏse  
Wel bet þan þeẏ can hemself deuẏse  
Som man defineþ for to haue richesse  
That cause is of his mordre or gret seknesse  
And som wolde out of his prison̄ fain
