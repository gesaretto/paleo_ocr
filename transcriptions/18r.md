To sleen himself he wayteþ priuely  
He seide allas þat day þat I was born  
Now is my prison̄ worse þan biforn  
Now is me schape eternaly to dwelle  
Nought in Purgatori but in helle  
Allas þat euer I knew Ꝑotheus  
ffor elles hadde I haue dwelled with Theseus  
I fetered in his prison̄ eueremo  
Thanne hadde I ben in blisse and not in woo  
Only þe sight of hire whom þat I serue  
þough þat I neuer hire grace may deserue  
Wolde haue y suffised right ynough for me  
¶ Oo deere Cosyn Palamon qd he  
Thin is þe victorie of þis auenture  
fful blissefully in prison̄ might þou dure  
In p̉soun certes nay but paradys  
Wel haþ fortune torned þe þe dys  
That hast þe right of hire and I þabsence  
ffor possible is syn þou hast hir p̔sence  
And art a knight a worþi and an able  
That by som caas syn fortune is changeable  
Thou maist somtyme to þi desir atteyne  
But I þat am exiled and bareyne  
Of alle grace and in so gret despeire  
That þer nys erþe water fyr ne eyre  
Ne creature þat of hem maked is  
That may me helpe or don confort in þis  
Wel ought I sterue in wanhope and distresse  
ffare wel my lif my lust and my gladnesse  
Allas why pleynen men so in comune  
On purueance of god or of fortune  
That ȝiueth hem ful ofte in many a gyse  
Wel bet þan þey can hemself deuyse  
Som man defineþ for to haue richesse  
That cause is of his mordre or gret seknesse  
And som wolde out of his prison̄ fain
