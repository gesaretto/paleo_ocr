Now lokeþ is not þat an heih folye  
¶ Who maẏ ben a fool but if he loue  
Bẏhold for goddes sake þat fitteþ aboue  
See how þai bleede be þai not wel arraẏed  
Thus haþ hire lord þe god of loue ẏ paiȝed  
Hire wages and hire fees for hire seruise  
And ȝit þei wenen for to ben ful wise  
That seruen loue for aught þat maẏ bifaỻ  
But þis is ȝet þe beste game of aỻ  
That sche for wham þei haue þis iolyte  
Can hem þerfore as moche þank as me  
Sche woot na more of aỻ þis hoote fare  
Bẏ god þan woot a Cockow of an hare  
But al moot ben assaẏed hoot and colde  
A man moot ben a fool or ȝong or olde  
I wot it bẏ mẏ self ful ẏore agon  
ﬀor in mẏ tyme a seruant was I on  
And þerfore sẏn I knowe of loues peẏne  
And woot how sore it can a man distreẏne  
As he þat hath ben caught often in his laas  
I you forȝiue al hollẏ þis trespas  
At þe requeste of þe queen þat kneeleþ heere  
And eek of Emelye my soster deere  
And ȝe schal boþe anon vnto me swere  
That neuere ȝe schal mẏ coroune dere  
Ne make werre vpon me night ne daẏ  
But ben mẏ frendes in aỻ þat ȝe may  
I ȝou forȝiue þis trespas eủẏ del  
And þeẏ him sworen his axing fair and wel  
And him of lordschipe and of mercy preide  
And he hem g̃unteþ grace and þus he seide  
To speke of riaỻ lynage and richesse  
þough þat sche were a queen or a princesse  
Ech of ȝou boþe is worþẏ douteles  
To wedde whan tyme is but naþeles  
I speke as for mẏ suster Emelye
