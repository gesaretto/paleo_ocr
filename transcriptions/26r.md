Now lokeþ is not þat an heih folye  
¶ Who may ben a fool but if he loue  
Byhold for goddes sake þat fitteþ aboue  
See how þai bleede be þai not wel arrayed  
Thus haþ hire lord þe god of loue y paiȝed  
Hire wages and hire fees for hire seruise  
And ȝit þei wenen for to ben ful wise  
That seruen loue for aught þat may bifall  
But þis is ȝet þe beste game of all  
That sche for wham þei haue þis iolyte  
Can hem þerfore as moche þank as me  
Sche woot na more of all þis hoote fare  
By god þan woot a Cockow of an hare  
But al moot ben assayed hoot and colde  
A man moot ben a fool or ȝong or olde  
I wot it by my self ful yore agon  
ffor in my tyme a seruant was I on  
And þerfore syn I knowe of loues peyne  
And woot how sore it can a man distreyne  
As he þat hath ben caught often in his laas  
I you forȝiue al holly þis trespas  
At þe requeste of þe queen þat kneeleþ heere  
And eek of Emelye my soster deere  
And ȝe schal boþe anon vnto me swere  
That neuere ȝe schal my coroune dere  
Ne make werre vpon me night ne day  
But ben my frendes in all þat ȝe may  
I ȝou forȝiue þis trespas eu̔y del  
And þey him sworen his axing fair and wel  
And him of lordschipe and of mercy preide  
And he hem g̃unteþ grace and þus he seide  
To speke of riall lynage and richesse  
þough þat sche were a queen or a princesse  
Ech of ȝou boþe is worþy douteles  
To wedde whan tyme is but naþeles  
I speke as for my suster Emelye
