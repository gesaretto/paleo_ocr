Theẏ foẏnen ech at oþer wonder longe  
Thou mightest wene þat þis Palamon  
In his fightinge were a wood leon̄  
And as a cruel tigre was arcite  
As wilde bores gonne þei to smyte  
That frothen whit as foom for ne wood  
vp to þe ancle foughte þeẏ in here blood  
And in þis wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle  
And forþ I wole of Theseus ẏou telle  
The destenẏe Ministre gen̔al  
That executeþ in þe world ouer al  
The purueance þat god haþ seie bifore  
So strong it is þat þei þe world hadde it swore  
The contraire of a þing be ȝe or naẏ
ȝet som tyme it schal falle on a daẏ  
þat falleþ nought eft wiþinne a þousend ȝere  
ﬀor certeinly oure appetites heere  
Be it of werre or pees or hate or loue  
Al is þis reuled bẏ þe fight aboue  
This mene I now bẏ mightẏ Theseus  
That for to hunte is so desirous  
And namly atte grete hert in may  
That in his bedde þer daweþ him no daẏ  
That he nẏs cladde and redẏ for to ride  
Wiþ hunte and horn and houndes hym besyde  
ﬀor in his huntẏng haþ he such delit  
That it is aỻ his ioẏe and appetẏt  
To ben himself þe grete hertes bane  
ﬀor after mars he serueþ now Diane  
Cler was þe daẏ as I haue told er þis  
And Theseus with alle ioẏe and blys  
With his ẏpolita þe faire queene  
And Emelye cloþed al in greene  
On huntyng ben þei riden reallẏ  
And to þe groue þat stood ful faste bẏ  
In which þer was an hert as men him tolde
