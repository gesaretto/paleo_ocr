ﬀor which he haþ deserued to be ded  
ﬀor þis is he þat com vnto þi gate  
And seẏde þat he highte Philostrate  
Thus haþ he Iaped þe ful manẏ a ȝeere  
And þou hast maked him þi cheef squiere  
And þis is he þat loueþ Emelẏe  
ﬀor siþ þat daẏ is come þat I schal dẏe  
I make pleẏnly mẏ confession̄  
That I am þilke woful Palamon

I am þi mortel foo ⁊ am I  
That loueþ so hote Emelya þe brighe  
That I wol dẏe p̔sent in hir sighte  
Wher fore I axe deþ and my Iuwise  
But sle mẏ felawe in þe same wise  
ﬀor boþe haue we deserued to be slaẏn  
¶ This worþi duk answerde anon agayn  
And seide þis is a schort conclusioun

Haþ dampned ȝou and I wol it recorde  
It needeþ nought to pẏne ȝou with þe corde

The queen anon for verreẏ wōmanhede  
Com for to wepe and so dide Emelye  
And aỻ þe ladies of þe compaignẏe  
Gret pite was it as it þougħt hem aỻ
That euer such a chaunce schulde falle  
ﬀor gentil men þei were of gret estat  
And noþing but for loue was þis debat  
And saugħ hire bloodẏ woundes wide and sore  
And aỻ crẏeden boþe lasse and more  
Haue mercẏ lord vpon vs wōmen aỻ  
And on here bare knees doun þei faỻ  
And wolde haue kist his feet þer as he stood  
Til atte laste aslaked was his mood  
ﬀor pite renneþ sone in gentil herte
