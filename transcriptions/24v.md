Duk Theseus þe streighte weẏ haþ holde  
And to þe lannde he rideþ him ful righte  
ﬀor þider was þe hert wont to haue his flighte  
And ouer a brook and so forþ on his weẏ  
This Duk wol haue a course at him or tweẏ  
Wiþ houndes swich as þat him list comaūde  
And whan þis Duk was come vnto þe launde  
vnder þe sonne he loked and anon  
He was war of arcite and Palamon  
That foughten breeme as it were boles tuo  
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro  
So hidouslẏ þat with þe leste strook
It semeþ þat it wolde felle an ook  
But what þei were noþing he ne woot  
This duk his courser with his spores smot  
And at a stert he was betwixe
