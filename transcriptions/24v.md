Duk Theseus þe streighte weẏ haþ holde  
And to þe lannde he rideþ him ful righte  
ﬀor þider was þe hert wont to haue his flighte  
And ouer a brook and so forþ on his weẏ  
This Duk wol haue a course at him or tweẏ  
Wiþ houndes swich as þat him list comaūde  
And whan þis Duk was come vnto þe launde  
vnder þe sonne he loked and anon  
He was war of arcite and Palamon  
That foughten breeme as it were boles tuo  
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro  
So hidouslẏ þat with þe leste strook  
It semeþ þat it wolde felle an ook  
But what þei were noþing he ne woot  
This duk his courser with his spores smot  
And at a stert he was betwixe hem tuo  
And pulled out a swerd and cried ho  
No more vp peẏne of lesyng of ȝour̉ hed  
Bẏ mightẏ mars he schal anon be ded  
That smẏteþ enẏ strok þat I maẏ seen  
But telleþ me what mẏster men ȝe ben  
That ben so hardẏ for to fighten heere  
Wiþoute Iuge or oþer officere  
As it were in a liteỻ liste really  
¶ This Palamon answerde hastily  
And seide sire what needeþ wordes mo  
We haue þe deþ deserued boþe tuo  
Tuo wofil wrecches be we tuo caẏtẏues  
That ben encombred of oure owne lẏues  
And as þou art a rightful lord and Iuge  
Ne ȝive vs neyþer mercẏ ne refuge  
But slee me first for seinte charite  
Or slee him for þough þou knowest it lite  
This is þi mortel fo þis is arcite  
That fro þi lond is banẏssched on his heede
