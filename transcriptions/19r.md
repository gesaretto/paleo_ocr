More þan is mẏn þat sterue her in a kage  
ﬀor I mot weepe and waẏle whil þat I lyue  
With aỻ þe woo þat prison̄ may me ȝiue  
And eek with peẏne þat loue me ẏueþ also  
That doubleþ al my torment and mẏ wo  
Ther with þe fẏr of gelousie vpsterte  
With Inne his brest and hente him bẏ þe herte  
So woodlẏ þat he lik was to byholde  
The boxtre or þe asshen deed and colde  
Than seide he o cruel goddes þat gouerne  
This world with bẏnding of your word eterne  
And writen in þe table of athamaunt  
ẏoure ꝑlement and ȝour eterne gǖnt  
What is mankynde more vnto ȝou holde  
Than is þe scheep þat roukeþ in þe folde  
ﬀor slain is man right as anoþer beeste  
And dwelleþ eek in p̉son̄ and in arreste  
And haþ siknesse and gret aduersite  
And ofte tymes gilteles ꝑ de  
¶ What gouernance is in þis prescience  
That gilteles tormenteþ Innocence  
And encreseth þis is al mẏ penaūce  
That man is bounden to his obẜuaūce  
ﬀor goddes sake to letten of his wille  
Ther as a beeste may aỻ his lust fulfiỻ  
And whan a beeste is ded he haþ no peyne  
But after his deth þe man mot weepe [__!__] pleyne  
Though in þis world he haue care and wo  
Wiþouten doute it maẏ stonden so  
The answere of þis lete I to diuines  
But wel I wot þat in þis world gret pyne is  
Allas I see a ẜpent or a þeef  
That many a treweman haþ do meschief  
Gon at his large and wher him list maẏ turne  
But I moot ben in p̉son̄ þurgħ Saturne  
And eek þurgh Iuno Ialous and eek wood
