More þan is myn þat sterue her in a kage  
ffor I mot weepe and wayle whil þat I lyue  
with all þe woo þat prison̄ may me ȝiue  
And eek with peyne þat loue me yiueþ also  
That doubleþ al my torment and my wo  
Ther with þe fyr of gelousie vpsterte  
with Inne his brest and hente him by þe herte  
So woodly þat he lik was to byholde  
The boxtre or þe asshen deed and colde  
Than seide he o cruel goddes þat gouerne  
This world with bynding of your word eterne  
And writen in þe table of athamaunt  
youre ꝑlement and ȝour eterne gũnt  
what is mankynde more vnto ȝou holde  
Than is þe scheep þat roukeþ in þe folde  
ffor slain is man right as anoþer beeste  
And dwelleþ eek in p̉son̄ and in arreste  
And haþ siknesse and gret aduersite  
And ofte tymes gilteles ꝑ de  
¶ what gouernance is in þis prescience  
That gilteles tormenteþ Innocence  
And encreseth þis is al my penaūce  
That man is bounden to his obẜuaūce  
ffor goddes sake to letten of his wille  
Ther as a beeste may all his lust fulfill  
And whan a beeste is ded he haþ no peyne  
But after his deth þe man mot weepe ⁊ pleyne  
Though in þis world he haue care and wo  
wiþouten doute it may stonden so  
The answere of þis lete I to diuines  
But wel I wot þat in þis world gret pyne is  
Allas I see a ẜpent or a þeef  
That many a trewe man haþ do meschief  
Gon at his large and wher him list may turne  
But I moot ben in p̉son̄ þurgh Saturne  
And eek þurgh Iuno Ialous and eek wood
