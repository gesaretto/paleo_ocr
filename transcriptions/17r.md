To helpe me if it lay in thy might  
Or elles art þou fals I dar wel sayn  
This Arcite ful proudly spak agayn  
Thou schalt quod he be raþer fals þan I  
But þou art fals I telle þe witterly  
¶ﬀor ꝑamour I loued hir first er þou  
What wilt þou seyn þou wist it nought yit now  
Wheþur sche be a wōman or goddesse  
Thin is affectiōn̄ of holynesse  
And myn is loue as to a creature  
ﬀor which I tolde þe myn auenture  
As to my cosyn and to my broþer sworn  
I pose þat þou louedest hire biforn  
Wostow nought wel þe olde clerkes sawe  
That who schal ȝiue a louer eny lawe  ¶Quis legẻ dat amantibꝫ  
loue is a gretter lawe by my pan  
Than may be yeue to eny erthly man  
And þerfore positif lawe and such decree  
Is broke alday for loue in eche degree  
A man moot needes loue maugre his hede  
He may not fleen hit þough he scholde be dede  
Al be sche mayde or wydow or elles wif  
And eek it is not likly al þi lif  
To stonden in hir grace namore schal I  
ﬀor wel þou wost þi selue verreily  
That þou and I ben dampned to prisoōn̄  
Ꝑpetuelly vs gaigneth no Ramsōn̄  
We stryuen now as houndes for þe bon  
They fought alday and ȝet here part was non  
Ther com a kyte whil þat þei were so wroþe  
That bar a way þe bon bytwixe hem boþe  
Ak þerfore atte kinges court my broþer  
Ech man for him self þer is non oþer  
loue if þou list for I loue and ay schal  
A soothly leue broþer þis is al  
her in þis prisōn̄ mote we endure
