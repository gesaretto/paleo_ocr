That he ful sone haþ plesed euerẏ parte  
A soþ is seẏde elde haþ gret auantage  
In eelde is boþe wisdom and vsage  
Men maẏ þe olde at renne and nought a trede  
Saturne anoon to stynte strif and drede  
Al be it þat it is agaẏn his kinde  
Of aỻ þis strif he gan remedẏe fẏnde  
Mẏ deere doughter Venus qd Saturne  
Mẏ cours þat haþ so wide for to turne  
Haþ more power þan wot anẏ man  
Mẏn is þe drynclyng in þe see so wan  
Mẏn is þe prison̄ in þe derke cote  
Mẏn is þe strangle and hangẏng bẏ þe þrote  
The murmure and þe cherles rebellinge  
The gronẏng and þe priue emp̉sonynge  
I do vengeance and plein correccion̄  
Wil I dwelle in þe signe of þe leon̄  
Mẏn is þe ruine of þe hihe halles  
The fallẏng of þe toures and of þe walles  
vpon þe mẏnour and þe Carpenter  
I slough Sampson schakynge þe piler  
And mẏne ben þe maladies colde  
þe derke tresons and þe castes olde  
my lokyng is þe fader of pestilence  
Now weep namore I schal don diligence  
That Palamon þat is þin owne knight  
Schal haue his ladẏ as þou him bihigħt  
Though mars schal helpe his knight ȝet naþeles  
Betwixe ȝow þer moot be som tyme pees  
Aỻ be ȝe nougħt boþe of oo compexion̄  
That causeþ aldaẏ swich diuision̄  
I am þin aẏell redẏ ad þi wille  
Weepe now namore I wil þi lust fulfille  
¶ Now wol I stente of þe goddes aboue  
Of mars and of venus goddesses of loue  
And telle yow as pleinly as I can
