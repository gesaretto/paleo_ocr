That he ful sone haþ plesed euery parte  
A soþ is seyde elde haþ gret auantage  
In eelde is boþe wisdom and vsage  
Men may þe olde at renne and nought a trede  
Saturne anoon to stynte strif and drede  
Al be it þat it is agayn his kinde  
Of all þis strif he gan remedye fynde  
My deere doughter Venus qd Saturne  
My cours þat haþ so wide for to turne  
Haþ more power þan wot any man  
Myn is þe drynclyng in þe see so wan  
Myn is þe prison̄ in þe derke cote  
Myn is þe strangle and hangyng by þe þrote  
The murmure and þe cherles rebellinge  
The gronyng and þe priue emp̉sonynge  
I do vengeance and plein correccion̄  
Wil I dwelle in þe signe of þe leon̄  
Myn is þe ruine of þe hihe halles  
The fallyng of þe toures and of þe walles  
vpon þe mynour and þe Carpenter  
I slough Sampson schakynge þe piler  
And myne ben þe maladies colde  
þe derke tresons and þe castes olde  
my lokyng is þe fader of pestilence  
Now weep namore I schal don diligence  
That Palamon þat is þin owne knight  
Schal haue his lady as þou him bihight  
Though mars schal helpe his knight ȝet naþeles  
Betwixe ȝow þer moot be som tyme pees  
All be ȝe nought boþe of oo compexion̄  
That causeþ alday swich diuision̄  
I am þin ayell redy ad þi wille  
Weepe now namore I wil þi lust fulfille  
¶ Now wol I stente of þe goddes aboue  
Of mars and of venus goddesses of loue  
And telle yow as pleinly as I can
