And with þat sight hir beaute hurt him so  
That if þat Palamon was wounded sore  
Arcite is hurt as muche as he or more  
And with a syke he seyde pitously  
The freissche beaute sleþ me sodeinly  
Of hire þat rometh in þe yonder place  
And but I haue hir mercy and hir grace  
That I may seen hir atte leste wey  
I nam but ded þer nys no more to sey  
This Palamon whan he þis wordes herde  
Dispitously he loked and answerde  
Wheþ&#777; seistow þis in ernest or in pleye  
Nay qd Arcite in ernest by my feye  
God helpe me so me lust ful yuel playe  
This Palamon gan knet his browes twaye  
It were to þe quod he no gret honour  
ffor to be fals ne for to be traytour  
To me þat am þi cosyn and þi broþer  
y sworn ful deepe and ech of vs til oþer  
That neuer for to deyen in þe payn  
Til þat þe deþ departe schal us twayn  
Neither in loue for to hinder oþer  
Ne in non oþer cas my lieue broþer  
But þat þou scholdest trewly forþer more  
In euery caas and I schal forþre þe more  
This was þin oþ and myn also certeine  
I wot right wel þou darst it not wiþ seyne  
Thus art þou of my counseil out of doute  
And now þou woldest falsly ben aboute  
To loue my lady whom I loue and serue  
And euer schal til þat myn herte sterue  
Now certes fals Arcite þou schalt not so  
I loued hir ferst and tolde þe my wo  
As to my counseil and my broþer sworn  
To forthre me as I haue told biforn  
ffor which þou art y bounden as a knight
