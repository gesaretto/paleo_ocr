I am so confuse þat I can not seẏe  
But mercẏ ladẏ bright þat knowest wele  
My þought and seest what harmes þat I feele  
Considere al þis and rewe vpon mẏ soore  
As wislẏ as I schal for euermore  
Emforth mẏ might þi trewe ẜuan̄t be  
And holden werre alweẏ wiþ chastite  
That I make myn avow so ȝe me helpe  
I keepe nougħt of armes for to ẏelpe  
Ne I ne axe nought to morwe to haue victorie  
Ne renon̄ in þis caas ne veine glorie  
Of pris of armes blowen vp and doun  
But I wolde haue fully possessioun  
Of emelẏe and dẏe in þi ẜuise  
ﬀynde yow þe maner how and in what wise  
I recche nat but it maẏ bettre be  
To haue victorie of hem or þei of me  
So þat I maẏ haue mẏ ladẏ in mȳ armes  
ﬀor þough so be þat mars is god of armes  
ẏoure vertue is so gret in heuen aboue  
That if ẏow list I schal wel haue mẏ loue  
Thẏ temple wil I worschipe euermo  
An on þin auter wher I ride or go  
I wil don sacrifice and feeres beete  
And if ȝe wol not so mẏ ladẏ sweete  
Than praẏ I þe to morwe with a spere  
þat arcite me þurgh þe herte bere  
Than rekke I nat whan I haue lost mẏ lẏf  
þough þat arcite wynne hir to his wẏf  
This is þeffect and ende of mẏ preyere  
ẏif me mẏ loue þou blisful ladẏ deere  
whan þe orison̄ was don of Palamon  
his sacrifise he dide and þat anon  
ﬀul pitouslẏ wiþ aỻ circumstances  
All telle I not as now his obẜuances  
But atte laste þe Statue of Venus schook
