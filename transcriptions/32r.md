I am so confuse þat I can not seye  
But mercy lady bright þat knowest wele  
My þought and seest what harmes þat I feele  
Considere al þis and rewe vpon my soore  
As wisly as I schal for euermore  
Emforth my might þi trewe ẜuan̄t be  
And holden werre alwey wiþ chastite  
That I make myn aVow so ȝe me helpe  
I keepe nought of armes for to yelpe  
Ne I ne axe nought to morwe to haue victorie  
Ne renon̄ in þis caas ne veine glorie  
Of pris of armes blowen vp and doun  
But I wolde haue fully possessioun  
Of emelye and dye in þi ẜuise  
ffynde yow þe maner how and in what wise  
I recche nat but it may bettre be  
To haue victorie of hem or þei of me  
So þat I may haue my lady in mȳ armes  
ffor þough so be þat mars is god of armes  
youre vertue is so gret in heuen aboue  
That if yow list I schal wel haue my loue  
Thy temple wil I worschipe euermo  
An on þin auter wher I ride or go  
I wil don sacrifice and feeres beete  
And if ȝe wol not so my lady sweete  
Than pray I þe to morwe with a spere  
þat arcite me þurgh þe herte bere  
Than rekke I nat whan I haue lost my lyf  
þough þat arcite wynne hir to his wyf  
This is þeffect and ende of my preyere  
yif me my loue þou blisful lady deere  
whan þe orison̄ was don of Palamon  
his sacrifise he dide and þat anon  
fful pitously wiþ all circumstances  
All telle I not as now his obẜuances  
But atte laste þe Statue of Venus schook
