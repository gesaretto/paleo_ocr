The blood Roial of Cadme and Amphion̄  
Of Cadmus which þat was þe ferste man  
That Thebes bult or ferst þe toun bigan  
And of þe cite first was crouned king  
Of his lynage am I and his ofspring  
Bẏ verraẏ ligne as of þe stok roiaỻ  
And now I am so caytif and so praỻ  
That he þat is mẏ mortel enemẏ  
I serue him as his squier pouerlẏ  
And ȝit doþ me Iuno wel more schame  
ﬀor I dar nought biknowe myn owene name  
but þer as I was wont to hight arcite  
Now highte I Philostrate nought worþ a mẏte  
Allas þou felle mars allas þou Juno  
Thus haþ ẏour ire oure lignage al fordo  
Gaf onlẏ me and wrecched Palamon  
That Theseus martireþ in prison̄  
And ouer al þis to slen me vtterlẏ  
loue haþ his faire dart so brennyngly.  
ẏ stiked þurgh mẏ trewe carful herte  
That schapen was mẏ deþ arst þan mẏ scherte  
ẏe sleen me with ȝour eyȝen emelye  
ȝe ben þe cause wher fore þat I dẏe  
Of aỻ þe remanant of mẏn oþer care  
Ne sette I nought þe montance of a tare  
So þat I cowde don aught to ȝoure plesance  
And with þat word he fel doun in a traunce  
A long tẏme and aftirward he vpsterte  
This Palamon þat þought þat þorugh his herte   
He felte a cold swerd sodeinliche glyde  
ﬀor yre he quok no lenger wolde he bẏde  
And whan þat he had herd Arcites tale  
As he were wood with face deed and pale  
he sterte him vp out of þe buskes þikke  
And seide arcite false traẏtour wikke  
Now art þou hent þat louest mẏ ladẏ so
