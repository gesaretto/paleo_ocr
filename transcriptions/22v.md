The blood Roial of Cadme and Amphion̄  
Of Cadmus which þat was þe ferste man  
That Thebes bult or ferst þe toun bigan  
And of þe cite first was crouned king  
Of his lynage am I and his ofspring  
By verray ligne as of þe stok roiall  
And now I am so caytif and so prall  
That he þat is my mortel enemy  
I serue him as his squier pouerly  
And ȝit doþ me Iuno wel more schame  
ﬀor I dar nought biknowe myn owene name  
but þer as I was wont to hight arcite  
Now highte I Philostrate nought worþ a myte  
Allas þou felle mars allas þou Juno  
Thus haþ your ire oure lignage al fordo  
Gaf only me and wrecched Palamon  
That Theseus martireþ in prison̄  
And ouer al þis to slen me vtterly  
loue haþ his faire dart so brennyngly.  
y stiked þurgh my trewe carful herte  
That schapen was my deþ arst þan my scherte  
ye sleen me with ȝour eyȝen emelye  
ȝe ben þe cause wher fore þat I dye  
Of all þe remanant of myn oþer care  
Ne sette I nought þe montance of a tare  
So þat I cowde don aught to ȝoure plesance  
And with þat word he fel doun in a traunce  
A long tyme and aftirward he vpsterte  
This Palamon þat þought þat þorugh his herte   
He felte a cold swerd sodeinliche glyde  
ﬀor yre he quok no lenger wolde he byde  
And whan þat he had herd Arcites tale  
As he were wood with face deed and pale  
he sterte him vp out of þe buskes þikke  
And seide arcite false traytour wikke  
Now art þou hent þat louest my lady so
