And in þi temple I wil mẏ baner honge  
And aỻ þe armes of mẏ companẏe  
And eủemo vnto til þat daẏ I dẏe  
Eterne fire I wol bẏfore þe fẏnde  
And eek to þis avow I wil me bẏnde  
Mẏ berd mẏn here þat hongreþ longe a doun  
That neuer ȝet ne felte offension̄  
Of resour nor of schere I wil þe yiue  
And ben þi trewe ẜuant whil I liue  
Now lord haue rouþe vpon mẏ sorwes sore  
If me þe victorie I axe þe namore  
¶ The preyer stẏnte of Arcita þe stronge  
The rẏnges on the temple dore þat honge  
And eek þe dores clateren ful faste  
Of which arcita somwhat him agaste  
þe fyres brenden vp þe auter bright  
That it gan al þe temple for to light  
And sweete smel the ground anon vp yaf  
And arcita anon his hand vp haf  
And more encense in to þe fir he caste  
With oþre rites moo and atte laste  
The statut of mars bigan his hauberk rynge  
And with þe soun he herd a mormoringe  
ﬀul lowe ⁊ dym þat seẏde þis victorie  
ﬀor which he ȝaf to mars honour and glorie  
And þus with ioẏe and hope wel to fare  
Arcite anon vnto his Inne is fare  
As faẏn as foul is of þe brighte sonne  
And right anon such strif is bẏgonne  
ﬀor þilke grauntẏng in þe heuen aboue  
Bitwixe venus þe goddesse of loue  
And Mars þe sterne god armipotent  
That Iubiter was besy it to stent  
Til þat þe pale Saturnus þe colde  
That knew so manẏ of auentures olde  
ﬀond in his olde exꝑience an arte
