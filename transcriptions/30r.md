And seyde helpe for þou mayst best of all  
Wel couþe he peynte lifly þat it wrought  
Wiþ many a floreyne he þe hewes bought  
Now ben þise listes maad an Theseus  
That at his grete cost arraied thus  
The temples and þe Theatres euerydel  
Whan it was don him liked wonder wel  
¶ But stynte I wol of Theseus alite  
And speke of Palamon and of arcite  
The day approcheþ and hir retornynge  
That eueriche scholde an hundred knightes bringe  
The bataille to darrayne as I ȝou tolde  
And til athenes hire couenant for to holde  
Haþ eu̔ych of hem brought an .C. knightes  
Wel armed for þe werre at all rightes  
And sikerly þer trowed many a man  
That neuer siþþen þat þe world bigan  
That for to speke of knighthode of here hond  
As ferre as god haþ maked see or lond  
Nas of so fewe so noble a companye  
ffor euery wight þat loued chiualrie  
And wolde his þankes haue a passant name  
Haþ preyed þat he mighte ben of þat game  
A wel was him þat þer to chosen was  
ffor if þer fille to morwe such a caas  
ȝe knowe wel þat euery lusty knight  
That loueþ ꝑamours and haþ his might  
Were it in Ingelond or elles where  
Thei wolde here þankes wilnen to be þere  
To fighte for a lady benedicite  
It were a lusty sighte for to see  
And right so ferden þey with Palamon  
With him þer wente knightes many on  
Som wol ben armed in an habergeon  
And in a brest plate and in a light Iepon  
And some wol haue a paire plates large
