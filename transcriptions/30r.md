And seẏde helpe for þou maẏst best of aỻ  
Wel couþe he peynte lifly þat it wrougħt  
Wiþ manẏ a floreẏne he þe hewes bougħt  
Now ben þise listes maad an Theseus  
That at his grete cost arraied thus  
The temples and þe Theatres euerẏdel  
Whan it was don him liked wonder wel  
¶ But stynte I wol of Theseus alite  
And speke of Palamon and of arcite  
The daẏ approcheþ and hir retornẏnge  
That eueriche scholde an hundred knightes bringe  
The bataille to darraẏne as I ȝou tolde  
And til athenes hire couenant for to holde  
Haþ eủẏch of hem brought an .C. knightes  
Wel armed for þe werre at aỻ rightes  
And sikerly þer trowed manẏ a man  
That neuer siþþen þat þe world bigan  
That for to speke of knighthode of here hond  
As ferre as god haþ maked see or lond  
Nas of so fewe so noble a companẏe  
ﬀor euerẏ wigħt þat loued chiualrie  
And wolde his þankes haue a passant name  
Haþ preẏed þat he mighte ben of þat game  
A wel was him þat þer to chosen was  
ﬀor if þer fille to morwe such a caas  
ȝe knowe wel þat euerẏ lustẏ knight
