In redoutẏng of mars and of his glorie  
Now to þe temple of Diane þe chaste  
As schortly as I can I wol me haste  
To telle ȝou aỻ þe discripcion̄  
Depeẏnted ben þe walles vp and don̄  
Of huntẏng and of schamefast chastite  
Ther saugh I how woful Calistope  
Whan þat Diane agreued was with here  
Was torned fro a wom̄an
