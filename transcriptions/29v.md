In redoutẏng of mars and of his glorie  
Now to þe temple of Diane þe chaste  
As schortly as I can I wol me haste  
To telle ȝou aỻ þe discripcion̄  
Depeẏnted ben þe walles vp and don̄  
Of huntẏng and of schamefast chastite  
Ther saugh I how woful Calistope  
Whan þat Diane agreued was with here  
Was torned fro a wom̄an til a bere  
And after was sche maad þe loode sterre  
Hire sone is eek a sterre as men may se  
Ther saugh I dane torned til a tree  
I mene nat þe goddesse Diane  
But Penneus doughter which þat hight Dane  
¶ Ther saugh I accheon an herte ẏ maked  
ﬀor vengance þat he saugh Diane al naked  
I saugh how þat his houndes haue him caught  
and freten him for þat þei knewe him naught  
ẏet ẏpeynted was a litel forþere more  
how atthalance hounted þe wilde bore  
And Meliagre and manẏ anoþer mo  
ﬀor which Diane wrought him care and wo  
Ther saugh I manẏ anoþer wonder storie  
The which me list nat drawe to memorie  
¶ This goddess on an hert ful wel hiegh seet  
Wiþ smale honndes aỻ aboute hir feet  
And vnder neþe hire feet sche hadde a moone  
Wexẏnge it was and schulde wanẏe soone  
In gaude greene hir statue cloþed was  
hir eẏhen caste sche ful lowe a doun  
Ther Pluto haþ his derke regioun  
A wōman trauaillẏnge was hire biforn  
But for hire childe so longe was vnborn  
ﬀul pitoulẏ lucẏna gan sche calle
