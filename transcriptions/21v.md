The gailler sleep he might not awake  
And þus he fleeth as fast as euer he maẏ  
The night was schort and faste bẏ þe daẏ  
That needes cost he most himseluen hyde  
And til a groue faste þer bisyde  
With dredful foot þan stalkeþ Palamon  
ﬀor schortly þis was his opinion  
That in þat groue he wolde him hide aldaẏ  
And in þe night þan woled he take his way  
To Thebes ward his frendes for to praẏ  
And schortly ouþer he wolde leese his lif  
Or wynnen Emely to his louely wif  
This is þeffecte and his entente playn  
¶ Now wol I torne vnto arcite agayn  
That litel wiste how neih þat was his care  
Til þat fortune hadde kaught him in his snare   
The besy larke messanger of daẏ  
Salueth in hir song þe morwe graẏ  
And fyrẏ phebus riseþ vp so bright  
That al þe orient laugheth of þe light  
And with his streemes drieth in þe greues  
The seluir dropes hangẏng in þe leeues  
And Arcita in þe court roial  
Wiþ Theseus his squier principal  
Is rẏsen and lokeþ on þe merẏ daẏ  
Out for to doon his obẜuance to maẏ  
Remembrẏng on þe poynt of his desir  
He on his courser stertyng as þe fir  
Is ryden in to þe feeldes him to pleẏe  
Out of þe court were it a mẏle or tweẏe  
And to þe groue of which þat I ȝou tolde  
Bẏ auenture his weẏe he gan to holde  
To maken him a garland of þe greues  
Were it of woodebẏnde or hawethorne leeues  
And loude he song aȝein þe sonne scheene
