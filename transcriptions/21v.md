The gailler sleep he might not awake  
And þus he fleeth as fast as euer he maẏ  
The night was schort and faste bẏ þe daẏ  
That needes cost he most himseluen hyde  
And til a groue faste þer bisyde  
With dredful foot þan stalkeþ Palamon  
ﬀor schortly þis was his opinion  
That in þat groue he wolde him hide aldaẏ  
And in þe night þan woled he take his way  
To Thebes ward his frendes for to praẏ  
And schortly ouþer he wolde leese his lif  
Or wynnen Emely to his louely wif  
This is þeffecte and his entente playn  
¶ Now wol I torne vnto arcite agayn  
That litel wiste how neih þat was his care  
Til þat fortune hadde kaught him in his snare
