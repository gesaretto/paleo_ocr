who lokeþ lighty now but Palamon̄  
who springeþ vp for ioye but arcite  
who couþe telle or who couþe it endite  
The ioye þat is maked in þe place  
whan Theseus haþ don so fair a grace  
But doun on knees went euery maner wight  
And þonked him wiþ aỻ here hert and might  
And namely þe Tebanes ofte siþe  
And þus wiþ good hope and wiþ herte bliþe  
They take þeir leue and homward gon þei ride  
To Thebes with olde walles wyde  
I trowe men wold it deme necligence  
yf I forȝete te tellen þe dispense  
Of Theseus þat goþ so busily  
To maken vp þe lystes ryally  
That such a noble theatre as it was  
I dar wel seyn in þe world þer nas  
The|circuite a Mile was aboute  
walled of stoon and diched al wiþoute  
Round was þe schap in maner of compas  
fful of degrees þe heighte of sixty paas  
Than whan a man was sette on oo degre  
he lettede nought his felawe for to see  
Estward þer stood a gate of marbel white  
westward right south anoþer in opposite  
And schortly to conclude such a place  
was non in erþe as in so litel a space  
ffor in þe lond þer nas no crafty man  
That Geometrie or ars metrike can  
Ne purtreiour ne keruer of ymages  
That Theseus ne gain him mete ⁊ wages  
The Teatre for to make and deuyse  
And for to don his rite and sacrifise  
he estward haþ vpon þe gate aboue  
In worschip of venus þe goddesse of loue  
Don make an auter and an oratorie
