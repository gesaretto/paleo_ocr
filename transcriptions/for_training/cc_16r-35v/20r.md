And waylyng al þe night makyng his mone  
And if he herde song or instrument  
Than wolde he weepe he mighte nought be stent  
So feble were his spiritz and he lowe  
And chaunged so þat no man couþe knowe  
his speche noþer his voys þough men it herde  
And in his gere for al þe world he ferde  
Not comly lyk to louers maladye  
Of heres but raþer lik manye  
Engendred of humõ malencolik  
Biforn his celle fantastik  
And schortly torned was al vp and doun  
Boþe habite and disposicion̄  
Of him þis woful louere daun arcite  
what scholde I alday of his woo endite  
whan he endured hadde a ȝeer or tuo  
This cruel torment and þis peyne and woo  
At Thebes in his contre as I seyde  
vpon a night in sleep as he him leyde  
him þoughte þat þe wengede god mercurie  
Biforn him stood and bad him to be merie  
his sleepy ȝerde in honde he bar vpright  
An hatte he wered vppon his heeres bright  
Arrayed was þis god as he took keepe  
As he was whan þat argus took his sleepe  
And seyde him þus to Athenes schalt þou wende  
Ther is þe schapen of þi wo an ende  
And with þat word arcite wook and sterte  
Now trewely how sore þat me smerte  
Quod he to Athenes right now wol I fare  
Ne for þe drede of deþ schal I nought spare  
To see my lady þat I loue and serue  
In hire presence I ne recche nouȝt to sterue  
And with þat word he caughte a gret mirour  
And saugh þat chaunged was al his colour  
And saugh his visage al in anoþer kinde
