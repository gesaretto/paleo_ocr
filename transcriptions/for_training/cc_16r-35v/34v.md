And in þi temple I wil my baner honge  
And aỻ þe armes of my companye  
And eủemo vnto til þat day I dye  
Eterne fire I wol byfore þe fynde  
And eek to þis avow I wil me bynde  
My berd myn here þat hongeþ longe a doun  
That neuer ȝet ne felte offension̄  
Of rasour nor of schere I wil þe yiue  
And ben þi trewe s̉uant whil I liue  
Now lord haue rouþe vpon my sorwes sore  
If me þe victorie I axe þe namore  
¶ The preyer stynte of Arcita þe stronge  
The rynges on the temple dore þat honge  
And eek þe dores clateren ful faste  
Of which arcita somwhat him agaste  
þe fyres brenden vp þe auter bright  
That it gan al þe temple for to light  
And sweete smel the ground anon vp yaf  
And arcita anon his hand vp haf  
And more encense in to þe fir he caste  
with oþre rites moo and atte laste  
The statut of mars bigan his hauberk rynge  
And with þe soun he herd a mormoringe  
fful lowe ⁊ dym þat seyde þis victorie  
ffor which he ȝaf to mars honour and glorie  
And þus with ioye and hope wel to fare  
Arcite anon vnto his Inne is fare  
As fayn as foul is of þe brighte sonne  
And right anon such strif is bygonne  
ffor þilke grauntyng in þe heuen aboue  
Bitwixe venus þe goddesse of loue  
And Mars þe sterne god armipotent  
That Iubiter was besy it to stent  
Til þat þe pale Saturnus þe colde  
That knewe so many of auentures olde  
ffond in his olde exꝑience an arte
