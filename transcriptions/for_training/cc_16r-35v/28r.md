Ne yet þe folie of king Salomon  
Ne ȝit þe grete strengþe of hercules  
Thenchauntementz of Medea and Circes  
Ne of Turnus wiþ þe hardy fiers corrage  
The riche Crysus kaytif in seruage  
Thus may ȝe seen þat wisdom ne richesse  
Beaute ne sleighte strengþe ne hardynesse  
Ne may wiþ venus holde chamꝑtye  
ffor as hire list þe world þanne may sche gye  
lo aỻ þise folk so kaught were in here lace  
Til þei for woo ful ofte seyde allase  
Suffiseth here ensamples oon or tuo  
And þough I couþe rekne a þousand mo  
The statue of venus glorious for to see  
was inaked fleetyng in þe large see  
And fro þe nauel doun al couered was  
wiþ wawes greene and bright as eny glas  
O citole in hir right hond hadde sche  
And on hire heed ful semely for to see  
A rose garlond freissch and wel smellynge  
Aboue hir heed hir doufes flykerynge  
Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido  
vpon his schuldernes wenges hadde he tuo  
And blynd he was as it is ofte seene  
A bowe he bar and arwes bright and keene  
whi schulde I nought as wel eek telle þe halle  
The purtraiture þat was vpon þe walle  
wiþinne þe temple of mighty mars þe reede  
Al peynted was þe wal in lengþe and brede  
lik to þe eestres of þe grisly place  
That highte þe grete temple of Mars in trace  
In þilke colde frosty regioun  
Ther as Mars haþ his soủaigne mansion̄  
ffirst on þe wal was peynted a foreste  
In which þer dwelled neyþer man ne beste  
wiþ knotty knarry bareyne trees olde
