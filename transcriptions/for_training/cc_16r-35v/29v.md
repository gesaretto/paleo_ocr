In redoutyng of mars and of his glorie  
Now to þe temple of Diane þe chaste  
As schortly as I can I wol me haste  
To telle ȝou aỻ þe discripcion̄  
Depeynted ben þe walles vp and don̄  
Of huntyng and of schamefast chastite  
Ther saugh I how woful Calistope  
whan þat Diane agreued was with here  
was torned fro a wom̄an til a bere  ¶Vrsa maior  
And after was sche maad þe loode sterre  
þus was sche peynted I can ȝou seye no ferre  
hire sone is eek a sterre as men may se  
Ther saugh I dane torned til a tree  
I mene nat þe goddesse diane  
But Penneus doughter which þat hight Dane  
¶ Ther saugh I accheon an herte y maked  
ffor vengance þat he saugh Diane al naked  
I saugh how þat his houndes haue him caught  
and freten him for þat þei knewe him naught  
yet ypeynted was a litel forþere more  
how atthalance hounted þe wilde bore  
And Meliagre and many anoþer mo  
ffor which Diane wrought him care and wo  
Ther saugh I many anoþer wonder storie  
The which me list nat drawe to memorie  
¶ This goddess on an hert ful wel hiegh seet  
wiþ smale honndes aỻ aboute hir feet  
And vnder neþe hire feet sche hadde a moone  
wexynge it was and schulde wanye soone  
In gaude greene hir statue cloþed was  
wiþ bowe in honde and arwes in a caas  
hir eyhen caste sche ful lowe a doun  
Ther Pluto haþ his derke regioun  
A wōman trauaillynge was hire biforn  
But for hire childe so longe was vnborn  
fful pitouly lucyna gan sche calle
