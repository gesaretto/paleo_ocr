ffor which he haþ deserued to be ded  
ffor þis is he þat com vnto þi gate  
And seyde þat he highte Philostrate  
Thus haþ he Iaped þe ful many a ȝeere  
And þou hast maked him þi cheef squiere  
And þis is he þat loueþ Emelye  
ffor siþ þat day is come þat I schal dye  
I make pleynly my confession̄  
That I am þilke woful Palamon  
þat haþ þi p̉son̄ broke wikkedely  
I am þi mortel foo ⁊ it am I  
That loueþ so hote Emelya þe brighe  
That I wol dye p̔sent in hir sighte  
wher fore I axe deþ and my Iuwise  
But sle my felawe in þe same wise  
ffor boþe haue we deserued to be slayn  
¶ This worþi duk answerde anon agayn  
And seide þis is a schort conclusioun  
your owne mouþ be ȝoure confession̄  
haþ dampned ȝou and I wol it recorde  
It needeþ nought to pyne ȝou with þe corde

The queen anon for verrey wōmanhede  
Com for to wepe and so dide Emelye  
And aỻ þe ladies of þe compaignye  
Gret pite was it as it þought hem aỻ   
That euer such a chaunce schulde falle  
ffor gentil men þei were of gret estat  
And noþing but for loue was þis debat  
And saugh hire bloody woundes wide and sore  
And aỻ cryeden boþe lasse and more  
haue mercy lord vpon vs wōmen aỻ  
And on here bare knees doun þei faỻ   
And wolde haue kist his feet þer as he stood  
Til atte laste aslaked was his mood  
ffor pite renneþ sone in gentil herte
