Couered in cloth of gold diapred weel  
Com ridyng lyk þe god of armes mars  
his cote armure was of cloþ of Tars  
Couched with perles whit and round and grete  
his sadel was of brent gold newe I bete  
A mantelet vpon his schuldern̄ hangynge  
Bret ful of Rubyes reede as fyr sparclynge  
his crispe her lik rynges was I ronne  
And þat was yelow and glitering as þe sonne  
his nose was highe his eyen bright Cytryn  
his lippes rounde his colour was sanguyn  
A fewe frakenes in his face y spreynd  
Betwixe yelow and somdel blak y meynd  
And as a leon̄ he his lokyng caste  
Of fyue and twenty ȝeer his age I caste  
his berd was wel begonne for to springe  
his voys was as a trompe thunderinge  
vpon his heed he wered a laurer grene  
A garland freissche and lusty for to seene  
vpon his hand he bar for his deduyt  
An Egle tame as eny lilie whit  
And C. lordes hadde he with him þere  
Aỻ armed saue here heedes in al here gere  
fful richely in all maner þinges

were gadred in þis noble companye  
ffor loue and for encrees of chiualrie

fful many a tame leon̄ and lepart  
And in þis wise þise lordes aỻ and some  
Ben on þe soneday to þe Cite come  
Aboute p͛me and in þe toun alighte

whan he hadde brought hem in to his Cite  
And Inned hem eủich at his degre  
he festeþ hem and doþ so gret labour
