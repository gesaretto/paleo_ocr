And of þe westward in memorie  
Of mars he maked hath right such anoþer  
That coste largely of gold a foþer  
And northward in a toret on þe walle  
Of alabaustre whit and reed coralle  
An oratori riche for to see  
In worschip of Diane of chastite  
hath Theseus don wrought in noble wise  
But ȝit hadde I forgetyn to deuyse  
þe noble peyntyng and þe purtraitures  
The schap þe contienance and þe figures  
That weren in þise oratories þre  
fferst in þe temple of venus maist þou se  
wrought in þe walle ful pitous to biholde    
The broken sleepes and þe sikes colde  
þe sacrede teeres and þe waymentyng  
The fyre strokes of þe desyring  
That loues seruantz in þis lijf enduren  
The othes þat here couenantz ensuren  
Plesant and hope desir fol hardynesse  
Beaute and youþe bauderie Richesse  
Charmes and force lesynges flaterie  
Dispense bysynesse and Ialousie  
That werede of yalow of gooldes a garlond  
And a cukkow sittyng on his hond  
ffestes instrumentz karoles daunces  
lust and array and all þe circumstances  
Of loue which þat rekned and rekene schal  
By ordre were peynted on þe wal  
And mo þan I can make of mencion̄  
ffor sothly al þe mont of Citheron̄  
Ther venus haþ hir principal dwellyng  
was schewed on þe wal in portreying  
wiþ al þe gardyn and þe lustynesse  
Nat was forȝeten þe porter ydelnesse  
Ne Narcisus þe faire of yore agon
