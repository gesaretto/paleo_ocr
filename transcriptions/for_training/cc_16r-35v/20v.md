And right anon it ran him in his mynde  
Than siþen his face was so disfigured  
Of maladie þe which he hadde endured  
he mighte wel if þat he bar him lowe  
lyue in Athenes eueremore vnknowe  
And seen his lady wel neigh day by day  
And right anon he changed his array  
And cladde him as a poure laborer  
And al allone saf oonly a squier  
That knew his priuete and al þe caas  
which was desgised pouerly as he was  
To Athenes is he gon þe nexte way  
And to þe contre he wente vpon a day  
And atte gate he profred his seruise  
To drugge and drawe what so men wol deuise  
And schortly of þis matier for to sein  
he fille in office with a chamburlein  
The which þat was dwellyng with Emelye  
ffor he was wys and sone couþe aspye  
Of eu̔y ẜuant which þat serueþ here  
Wel couþe he hewen woode and water bere  
ffor he was yong and mighty for þe nones  
And þerto he was strong and bigge of bones  
To doon þat eny wight him can deuyse  
A yeer or tuo he was in þis seruise  
Page of þe Chambre of Emelye þe brighte  
And Philostrat he seyde þat he highte  
¶ But half so wel byloued aman as he  
Ne was þer neuer in court of his degre  
he was so gentil of condicion̄  
That þurgh out al the court was his renon̄  
Thei seide þat it were a charite  
That Theseus wolde enhaunce his degre  
And putten him in worschipful seruise  
Ther þat he might his vertu excercise  
And þus wiþinne a while his name is spronge
