They foynen ech at oþer wonder longe  
Thou mightest wene þat þis Palamon  
In his fightinge were a wood leon̄  
And as a cruel tigre was arcite  
As wilde bores gonne þei to smyte  
That frothen whit as foom for ne wood  
vp to þe ancle foughte þey in here blood  
And in þis wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle  
And forþ I wole of Theseus you telle  
The destenye Ministre gen̉al  
That executeþ in þe world ouer al  
The purueance þat god haþ seie bifore  
So strong it is þat þei þe world hadde it swore  
The contraire of a þing be ȝe or nay  
ȝet som tyme it schal falle on a day  
þat falleþ nought eft wiþinne a þousend ȝere  
ffor certeinly oure appetites heere  
Be it of werre or pees or hate or loue  
Al is þis reuled by þe fight aboue  
This mene I now by mighty Theseus  
That for to hunte is so desirous  
And namly atte grete hert in may  
That in his bedde þer daweþ him no day  
That he nys cladde and redy for to ride  
wiþ hunte and horn and houndes hym besyde  
ffor in his huntyng haþ he such delit  
That it is aỻ his ioye and appetyt  
To ben himself þe grete hertes bane  
ffor after mars he serueþ now Diane  
Cler was þe day as I haue told er þis  
And Theseus with alle ioye and blys  
with his ypolita þe faire queene  
And Emelye cloþed al in greene  
On huntyng ben þei riden really  
And to þe groue þat stood ful faste by  
In which þer was an hert as men him tolde
