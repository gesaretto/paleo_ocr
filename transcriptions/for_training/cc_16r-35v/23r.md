ffor whom þat I haue al þis peyne and wo  
And art my blood and to my counseil sworn  
As I ful ofte haue told þe heer biforn  
And hast be iaped here duk Theseus  
And falsly chaunged hast þi name þus  
I wol be ded or elles þou schalt dye  
Thou schalt not loue my lady Emelye  
But I wol loue hire oonly and nomo  
ffor I am Palamon þi mortel foo  
And þough þat I no wepene haue in þis place  
But out of p͛soun am astert by grace  
I drede nought þat ouþer þou schalt die  
Or þou ne schalt not louen Emelye  
Chees which þou wilt or þou schalt not asterte  
This arcite with ful dispitous herte  
when he him knew and hadde his tale herde  
As fers as leon̄ pulled out a swerde  
And seide þus by god þa fitteþ aboue  
Nere it were þat þou art sike and wood for loue  
And eek þat þou no wepne hast in þis place  
Thou schuldest neuer out of þis groue pace  
That þou ne schuldest deyen of myn honde  
ffor I diffie þe sewrte and þe bonde  
which þat þou seist I haue maad to þe  
what verray fool þink weel þat loue is fre  
And I wol loue hir maugre al þy might  
But for as moche þou art a worþy knight  
And willest to derreyne hir by batayle  
Haue her my trouþe to morwe I wol nought fayle  
wiþouten wityng of eny oþer wight  
That heer I wol be founden as a knight  
And bringen herneys right ynough for þe  
And chese þe beste and lef þe worste for me  
And mete and drynk þis night wol y bringe  
ynough for þe and cloþes for þi beddynge  
And if so be þat þou my lady wynne
