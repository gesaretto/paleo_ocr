Boþe of his deedes and of his goode tonge  
That Theseus haþ taken him so neere  
That of his Chambre he made him a squiere  
And gaf him golde to mayntene his degre  
And eek men brought him out of his contre  
ffro ȝeer to ȝeer ful priuily his rente  
But honestly and sleighly he it spente  
That no man wondred how þat he it hadde  
And þre ȝeer in þis wise his lif he ladde  
And bar him so in pees and eek in werre  
Ther was no man þat Theseus haþ derre  
And in þis blisse lete I now arcite  
And speke I wol of Palamon alite  
¶ In derknesse and horrible and strong p͛son̄  
This seuene ȝeer haþ seten Palamon̄  
fforpyned what for woo and for distresse  
who feleth double sore and heuynesse  
But Palamon þat loue drencheþ so  
That wood out of his wit he goþ for wo  
And eek þer to he is a prisoner  
Ꝑpetuelly not oonly for a ȝeer  
who couþe ryme in englissh ꝓpurly  
his martirdom for soþe it am not I  
Therfore I passe als lightly as I may  
¶ It felle þat in þe seuenþe ȝer of may  
The þridde night as olde bokes sein  
That als þis storie telleth more plein  
were it by auenture or destinee  
As whan a þing is schape it schal be  
That sone after þe mydnyght Palamon  
By helpyng of a frende brak prison̄  
And fleþ þe cite faste as he may goo  
ffor hadde yeue his gailler drinke soo  
Of a clarre maad of a certeyn wyn  
with nercotiks and opie of Thebes fyn  
That al þat night þough þat men wolde him schake
