And þer with al he bleynt and cryed a  
As þough he stongen were vnto þe herte  
And with þat crye Arcite anon vp sterte  
And seide Cosyn myn what eyleþ þe  
That art so pale and dedly on to se  
why crydestow who haþ þe don offence  
ffor goddes loue tak al in pacience  
Oure p͛soun for it may non oþer be  
ffortune haþ yiue vs þis aduersite  
Som wicke aspect or disposicion̄  
Of Saturne by som constellacion̄  
haþ ȝiuen vs þis al þough we had it sworn  
So stood þe heuen whan þat we ware born  
we mote endure it þis is schort and playn  
This Palamon answerd and seide again  
Cosyn for soþe of þis opynion̄  
þou hast a vain Imaginacion̄  
This p͛son̄ causede me nought to crie    
But I was hurt right now þorugh out myn yhe    
In to myn hert þat wol my bane be  
The fayrnesse of þat lady þat I see  
ȝonde in the gardyn rome to and fro  
Is cause of al my crying and my wo  
I not wher sche be wōman or goddesse  
But Venus is it sothly as I gesse  
And þer with al on knees a doun he fille    
And seyde Venus if it be þy wille  
yow in þis gardeyn þus to tñsfigure  
Byfore me sorwful wrecched creature  
Out of þis prison̄ help þat we mowe scape  
And if so be my destenye be schape  
By eterne world to deyen in p͛son̄  
Of oure lynage haue som compassion̄  
That is so lowe y brought by tyrannie  
And with þat word Arcite gan aspye  
wher as þis lady romed to and fro
