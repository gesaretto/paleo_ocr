As keepe me fro þi vengance and þin Ire  
That attheon aboughte cruelly  
Chaste goddesse wel wost þou þat I  
Desyre to ben a mayde all my lif  
Ne neuer wol I be no loue ne wijf  
I am þou wost ȝit of þy compaignie  
A maiden and loue huntyng and venerie  
And for to walken in the woodes wilde  
And nought to ben a wijf and be wiþ childe  
Nought wol I knowe compaignie of man  
Now helpe me lady siþþe ȝe may and can  
ffor þe þre formes þat þou hast in the  
And Palamon þat haþ swich loue to me  
And eek arcite þat loueþ me so sore  
This grace I preye ȝow wiþoute more  
And sende loue and pees bitwixe hem tuo  
And fro me torne awey here hertes so  
That all here hoote loue and here desire  
And all here besy torment and here fire  
Be queynt or torned in anoþer place  
And if so be þou wolt not do me g̃ce  
Or if my destyne be schape so  
That I schal needes haue oon of hem tuo  
As sende me him that most desireth me  
Biholde goddesse of clene chastite  
The bittre teeres þat on my cheekes falle  
Syn þou art maiden and keꝑe of vs all  
My maydenhode þou kepe and wel conserue  
And whil I lyue a maide I wol ȝou serue  
¶ The fires brennen vpo þe auter cleer  
whil Emelye was þus in hire preyer  
But sodeinly sche saugh a sighte queynte  
ffor right anon on of þe fyres queynte  
And quiked agayn and after þat anon  
That oþer fyr was queint and al a gon  
And as it queinte it made a whistlinge
