That in his hous is of his meyne slain  
Infinite harmes ben in þis matiere  
we wot not what þing þat we preyen heere  
we faren as he þat dronken is as Mous  
A dronke man wot wel he haþ an hous  
But he not which þe righte weie is þider  
And to a dronke man þe weye is slider  
And certes in þis world so faren we  
we seeken fast after felicite  
But we gon wrong ful ofte trewely  
Thus may we seyn aỻ and namlich I  
That wende and hadde a gret opynion̄  
That if I might skapen fro p̉son̄  
Than hadde I ben in joye and ꝑfyt hele  
Ther now I am exiled fro my wele  
Syn þat I may not seen ȝou Emelye  
I am but ded þer nys no remedye  
vpon þat oþer syde Palamon  
whan þat he wiste þat arcite was gon   
Swich sorwe he makeþ þat þe grete tour  
Resouneþ of his yollyng and clamour   
The pure fettres of his schynes grete   
were of his bittre salte teeres wete  
Allas qd he arcita cosyn myn  
Of aỻ our strif god wot þe fruyt is þin  
Thou walkest now in Thebes at þi large  
And of my woo þou yernest litel charge  
Thou maist syn þou hast wisdom and manhede  
Assemble aỻ þe folk of oure kinrede  
And make a werre so scharp on þis Cite  
That by som auenture or som tretee  
Thou maist haue hir to lady and to wif  
ffor whom þat I most needes leese my lif  
ffor as by weie of possibilite  
Sitthe þou art at þi large of prison̄ fre  
And art a lord gret is þin auantage
