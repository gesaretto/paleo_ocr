To eesen hem and don hem aỻ honour  
That yet men weneþ þat no mannes wit  
Of non estat ne couþe amenden it  
The menstralcye þe ẜiuse atte feste  
The grete ȝiftes to þe meste and leste  
The riche array of Theseus Paleys  
Ne who sat ferst ne last vpon þe deys  
what ladies fairest ben or best daunsynge  
Or which of hem can best daunsen or synge  
Ne who most felynglik spekeþ of loue  
what haukes sitten on þe ꝑche aboue  
what houndes liggen on þe flor adoun   
Of aỻ þis make I now no mencion̄  
But alle þeffecte þat þinkeþ me þe beste  
Now comeþ þe poynt and herkneþ if ȝou lest  
¶ The sonday night ar day bigan to springe  
whan Palamon þe larke herde synge  
Al þough it nere nought day by houres tuo  
ȝet song þe larke and Palamon right þo  
wiþ holy herte and with an heigh corage  
he ros to wenden on his pilgrimage  
vnto þe blissful Citharea benigne  
I mene Venus honorable and digne  
And in here houre he walkeþ forþ a paas  
vnto þe lystes þer hire temple was  
And doun he kneleþ and wiþ humble chere  
and herte sore he seyde as ȝe schal heere  
¶ ffairest of faire O lady myn Venus  
Doughter to Ioue and spouse to Vulcanus  
Thou glader of þe moūt of Citheron̄  
ffor þilke loue þou haddest to adon̄  
haue pite of my bittre teeres smerte  
and tak myn humble preier at þin herte  
Allas I ne haue no langage to telle  
Theffectes ne þe torment of myn helle  
Myn herte may mȳ harmes nought bewreye
