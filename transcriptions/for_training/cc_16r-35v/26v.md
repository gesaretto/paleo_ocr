ffor whom ȝe haue þis strif and Ialousie  
ȝe wite ȝoure self sche may not wedde tuo  
At oones þough ȝe fighten eu̔emo  
That oon of ȝou al be him loþ or leef  
he moot go pypen in an yuy leef  
This is to sey sche may not haue boþe  
Al be ȝe neuer so Ialouse ne so wroþe  
And for þi I ȝou putte in þis degre  
That ech of ȝou schal haue his destine  
As him is schape and herkneþ in what wise  
Lo heer ȝour ende of þat I schal deuyse  
¶ My wil is þis for plat conclusion̄  
wiþouten eny replicacion̄  
If þat ȝow likeþ takeþ it for þe beste  
That eu̔ych of ȝou schal gon wher him leste  
ffrely wiþouten Raunceon or daunger  
And þis day fifty wykes fer ne neer  
Euerich of ȝou schal bringe an hundred knightes  
Armed for þe lystes vp al rightes  
Al redy to darreyne hir by bataile  
And þis biheete I ȝou wiþoute faile  
vpon my trouþe and as I am a knight  
That wheþer of ȝou boþe þat haþ might  
This is to sein þat wheþer he or þou  
May with his hundred as I spak of now  
Sle his contrarie or out of lystes dryue  
That schal I ȝive Emelya to wyue  
To whom þat fortune ȝeueþ so fair a grace  
The lystes schal I maken in þis place  
And god so wisly on my soule rewe  
As I schal euen Iugge ben and trewe  
ȝe schal non oþer eende wiþ me maken  
þat on of ȝou ne schal ben deed or taken  
And if ȝou þinkeþ þis is wel y sayed  
Sey ȝour aVys and holdeþ ȝou appaied  
This is ȝour ende and ȝour conclusion̄
