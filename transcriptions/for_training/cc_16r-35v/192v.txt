Now was þer a Iustice in þe toun
That goủnour was of þat region̄
And so bifell þis Iuge his yhen caste
vppon þis mayde hire ful faste
As sche cam forthby þer þe Iuge stood
Anon his herte changeþ and his mood
So was he caught wiþ beaute of þis mayde
And to himself ful priuely he sayde
This mayde schal be my for ony man  
Anon þe feend in to his herte ran
And taught him sodeynly by what sleighte
þe mayde to his purpos wynne he mighte
ffor certes by no force ne by no meede
him þought he was not able for to speede
ffor he was strong of freendes and eek scho
Confermed was in such souereyn beaute
þat wel he wiste he might hire neuer wynne
As for to make hire wiþ hire body synne
ffor which wiþ gret deliberacion̄
he sente after a clerk in to þe toun̄
The which he knew for subtil and for bold
The Iuge vnto þis clerk his tale haþ told
In secre wise and made him to assure
he scholde telle it to no creature
And if he did he scholde leese his heed
Whan assented was þis cursed reed
Glad was þe Iuge and made glad chere
And ȝaf him ȝiftes precious and deere
Whan schapen was al þis conspiracie
ffrom poynt to poynt how þat his leccherie
Parformed schulde be ful subtilly
as ȝe shcal here aftirward openly
hom goþ þis clerk þat hight Claudius
þis false Iuge þat highte Apius
So was his name for it is no fable
But known for an historial þing notable
