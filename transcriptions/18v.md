That in his hous is of his meẏne slain  
Infinite harmes ben in þis matiere  
We wot not what þing þat we preẏen heere  
We faren as he þat dronken is as Mous  
A dronke man wot wel he haþ an hous  
But he not which þe righte weie is þider  
And to a dronke man þe weye is slider  
And certes in þis world so faren we  
We seeken fast after felicite  
But we gon wrong ful ofte trewely  
Thus may we seẏn aỻ and namlich I  
That wende and hadde a gret opẏnion̄  
That if I might skapen fro p̉son̄  
Than hadde I ben in joẏe and ꝑfyt hele  
Ther now I am exiled fro mẏ wele  
Syn þat I maẏ not seen ȝou Emelye  
I am but ded þer nẏs no remedẏe  
vpon þat oþer syde Palamon  
Whan þat he wiste þat Arcite was gon   
Swich sorwe he makeþ þat þe grete tour  
Resouneþ of his yollyng and clamour   
The pure fettres of his schẏnes grete  
Were of his bittre salte teeres wete
Allas qd he arcita cosy myn
Of aỻ our strif god wot þe fruẏt is þin
Thou walkest now in Thebes at þi large
And of mẏ woo þou ẏernest litel charge
Thou maist syn þou hast wisdom and manhede
Assemble aỻ þe folk of oure kinrede
And make a werre so scharp on þis Cite
