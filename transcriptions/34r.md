Of trace honoured art and lord ẏ holde  
And hast in euerẏ regne and euery londe  
Of armes al þe bridel in þin honde  
And hem fortunest as þe lest deuẏse  
Accepte of me mẏ pitous sacrifise  
If so be þat mẏ ẏouthe maẏ deserue  
And þat I mighte be worthy for to serue  
Thẏ godhede þat I maẏ ben oon of þine  
Than praẏ I þe to rewe vpon mẏ pẏne  
ﬀor þilke pyne and þilke hoote fyre  
In which þou whilom brendest for desire  
Whan þat þou vsedest þi beaute  
Of faire ȝonge freissche Venus free  
And haddest hire in armes at þi wille  
Al þough þe oones on a tẏme mẏsfille  
Whan Walcanus hadde caught þe in his laas  
And fond þe ligging bẏ his wijf allas  
ﬀor þilke sorwe þat was in þin herte  
Haue rouþe as wel vpon mẏ peẏnes smerte  
I am ẏong and vnconnẏng as þou wost  
And as I trowe with loue offended moost  
That euer was onẏ lyues creature  
ﬀor sche þat doth me aỻ þis woo endure  
Ne reccheþ neuer wher I synke or fleete  
And wel I woot ar sche me mercẏ heete  
I moot wiþ strengþe wẏnne hire in þe place  
And wel I woot wiþoute helpe or grace  
Of þe ne maẏ mẏ strengþe nought auaile  
Than helpe me lord to morwe in mẏ bataille  
ﬀor þilke fyr þat whilom brente þe  
As wel as þilke fir now brenneþ me  
And do þat I to morwe haue victorie  
Mẏn be þe trauaile and þin be þi glorie  
Thy souerein temple wil I most honouren  
Of enẏ place and alweẏ most labouren  
In þi plesance and in þi craftes stronge
