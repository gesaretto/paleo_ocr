Of trace honoured art and lord y holde  
And hast in euery regne and euery londe  
Of armes al þe bridel in þin honde  
And hem fortunest as þe lest deuyse  
Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise  
If so be þat my youthe may deserue  
And þat I mighte be worthy for to serue  
Thy godhede þat I may ben oon of þine  
Than pray I þe to rewe vpon my pyne  
ffor þilke pyne and þilke hoote fyre  
In which þou whilom brendest for desire  
Whan þat þou vsedest þi beaute  
Of faire ȝonge freissche Venus free  
And haddest hire in armes at þi wille  
Al þough þe oones on a tyme mysfille  
Whan Walcanus hadde caught þe in his laas  
And fond þe ligging by his wijf allas  
ffor þilke sorwe þat was in þin herte  
Haue rouþe as wel vpon my peynes smerte  
I am yong and vnconnyng as þou wost  
And as I trowe with loue offended moost  
That euer was ony lyues creature  
ffor sche þat doth me all þis woo endure  
Ne reccheþ neuer wher I synke or fleete  
And wel I woot ar sche me mercy heete  
I moot wiþ strengþe wynne hire in þe place  
And wel I woot wiþoute helpe or grace  
Of þe ne may my strengþe nought auaile  
Than helpe me lord to morwe in my bataille  
ffor þilke fyr þat whilom brente þe  
As wel as þilke fir now brenneþ me  
And do þat I to morwe haue victorie  
Myn be þe trauaile and þin be þi glorie  
Thy souerein temple wil I most honouren  
Of eny place and alwey most labouren  
In þi plesance and in þi craftes stronge
