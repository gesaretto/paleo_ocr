A þousand ẏ slaẏn and nougħt of qualme ẏ storue  
The Tiraunt with his preẏe his force thraste  
The toun destroied þer was noþing laste  
yet saugh I brent þe schippes hoppestereres  
The hunte strangled wiþ þe wilde breeres  
The sowe freten þe child right in þe cradel  
The cook I scalded for al his longe ladel  
Nought was forgeten bẏ þe infortune of marte  
The carter ouer Riden wiþ his carte  
vnder þe wheel ful lowe he laẏ a doun  
Ther were also of martis diuision̄  
The barbour and þe bocher and þe smith  
That forgeþ scharpe swerdes on his stith  
And aỻ aboue depeẏnted in a toure  
Saugh I conqueste in gret honoure  
With þe scharpe swerd ouer his heed  
Hangẏnge bẏ a subtyl twẏned þreed  
Depeynted was þe slaughtre of Iulius  
Of grete Nero and of Anthonius  
Al be þat ilke time þei were vnborn  
ȝet was hire deth depeynted þer biforn  
Bẏ manasẏng of mars right bẏ figure  
So was it schewed in þat purtreiture  
As is depeẏnted in þe sertres aboue  
Who schal be slain or elles deed for loue  
Sufficeþ oon ensample in stories olde  
I maẏ not rekne hem aỻ þougħ I wolde  
The statue of mars vpon a carte stood  
Armed and loked grẏm as he were wood  
And ouer his heed þer schineþ tuo figures  
Of sterres þat ben closed in scriptures  
That oon Puella þat oþer Rubeus  
This god of armes was arraẏed þus  
A wolf þer stood biforn him at his feete  
Wiþ eighen reede and of a man he eete  
Wiþ subtiỻ penseỻ was depeynted þis storie
