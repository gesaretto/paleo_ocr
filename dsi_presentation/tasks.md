- Visuals instead of blocks of text.

- See by Friday if Kraken is working; if it is, retrain it (with Grayscale and fixed whitespaces), and run tests with new transcriptions.

- Make a new table where we compare results across different manuscripts.

- Each section should be about 200 words; use as many words as possible.

1. **Topic and its importance** (Gianmarco)

    - Rearrange and condense the blurb. (About four sentences; 100-150 ww.)

        - Is there a statistic about the number of MSS that have been digitized, the number of MSS that have been transcribed and edited?

        - Something about the amount of work and skill involved in this process.

        - Something about the varieties of scripts and hands used; something about the orthographic differences in the text.

        - Searchable texts; texts "not on the radar"; big data analysis.

2. **Background information, methods, or system design** (Jenna)

    - System that has been used; compile our own transcriptions; show some of the issues with abbreviations, fixing images, getting the images...

    - Scribe D and other scribes? Canterbury Tales? Anglicana Formata?

    - Different letter shapes for the same letter...?

3. **Results**. This section will contain the table explaining the various results across different manuscripts. (Five manuscripts?)

4. **Conclusions and future recommendations** (Gianmarco)

    - More manuscripts digitized and publicly available; a standard for diplomatic transcriptions; refining the OCR system. Natural language processing?
