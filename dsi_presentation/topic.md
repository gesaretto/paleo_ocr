## Topic and Importance

Despite advances in manuscript digitization, most manuscripts from the Middle Ages remain inaccessible to the modern reader. Without print or digital transcriptions, scholars cannot read manuscript contents readily, search for relevant information, or perform wide-scale data analysis. Uniform and open-source transcriptions of many more medieval manuscripts are therefore essential to future research projects. However, human transcription is time-consuming and expensive: it requires a trained paleographer and hours of labor per manuscript. But machine learning may enable us to produce quick and large-scale transcriptions, thereby opening the field to more manuscript-specific and data-science driven research projects. Although OCR technology has improved dramatically in the past decades, existing engines, such as Google OCR and Tesseract, have consistently failed to process early handwritten documents, and medieval manuscripts in particular. Our project has successfully trained an OCR system to transcribe a single medieval script from 15th-century England, demonstrating the potential for this tool to effectively build a corpus of automatically-transcribed manuscripts.
